COUNTLESS are the graves of saints I have seen in
the city of Romulus, Valerian, Christ’s dedicated
servant. You ask for the inscriptions cut on their
tombs, and their individual names, but it is hard
for me to be able to repeat them. Such great
multitudes of the righteous did ungodly rage devour
while Trojan Rome still worshipped the gods of her
fathers. Many a grave is lettered and tells the
· martyr's name or bears some epitaph, but there are
mute marbles too, which shut up the tombs in silence
and only indicate the number3 you may learn what
masses of men's bodies lie gathered together in
heaps, but read the name of none of them. I
remember finding that the remains of sixty persons
were buried there under one massive stone, whose

century. Damasus says nothing about the manner of his
death. There is no reason to doubt that Prudentius saw and
correctly interpreted the picture which represented him as
having been torn to pieces by wild horses, like the Hippo-
lytus of the Greek mythology (see Contra Symm„ ΙΙ, 53 ff.)‚
but the picture may have owed its inspiration only to the
identity of the name. There is also confusion in Prudentius,
though not in Damasus, with a martyr Hippolytus of Portus
(39 f.)‚ who is mentioned in the Martyrology falsely ascribed
to Jerome. Portus was a town which had grown up round
the new harbour begun by Claudius and completed by
Trajan, north of Ostia. For discussions see &Alsa La
