of a pillar which, being able to pierce the gloom,
showed them the way by night with its bright flame
and the darkness was done away.“ Like them, the
devoted girl was deemed worthy to have the light of
day as she followed her course in the night, and was
not covered with darkness as she fled from the realm
of Egypt, winning a way beyond the stars. Stepping
quickly all through the night she covers many a mile

too ready to throw themselves away, denying God
who is the Father of all? Seek ye, O pitiable
company, the people who worship Christ? Here am
