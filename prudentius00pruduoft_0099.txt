A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

and grow old and feeble3 a nature which is doomed
to have an end is not free from imper-fection. At all
times, be assured, the sky has woven the fabric of
the years with varying increase. Some it has en-
riched with great abundance of produce, some it has
doomed to be ill-starred and barren, disappointing the
countryman's labour with hopes that turned out to be
empty and unfruitful. But if this cruel curse, which
arises from a world we cannot trust, is avenging the
Vestal maids, why does it not waste only the
Christians’ fields, since it is through them that the
established gifts are refused to your Virgins? We
have the benefit of the return from our land and our
method of tillage‚ and have no cause to regret the
labour of our hands: and if a stone α has stood there
which ancient superstition used to gird with bands
and petition with a hen’s lights, it is broken now and
Terminus is profaned by having no offering of
entrails, and the tree that was decked with ribbons
and used to hold smoking lanterns is felled by the
stroke of the avenging axe. But the produce of the
land is none the less for all that, nor the weather less
mild and cheerful and bright, nor the wind reduced,
which brings rain to allay the thirst of the ground
we have broken up and tilled. Yet men who live
soberly have no need of much, and when crops are
very plentiful we do not let ourselves go in pleasures
by reason of our abundant riches, nor do we spring
to seize the profit with greedy desire. For to those
whose hope is shaped for eternity every good thing
which this *present life brings is slight. Thrice happy

offered to the god by the neighbouring owners. The use of
yallinae pulmo in this connection is not elsewhere mentioned ;
Ovid speaks of a lamb or a sucking pig.
