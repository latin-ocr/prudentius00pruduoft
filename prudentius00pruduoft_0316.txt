AD VALERIANUM Emscopom m: PAssmNs
HIPPOLYTI Bmmssnn MAR'rvms.

INNummos cineres sanctorum Romula in urbe
vidimus, o Christi Valeriane sacer.

incisos tumulis titulos et singula quaeris
nomina: difficile est ut replicare queam.

tantos iustorum populos furor inpius hausit, 5
cum coleret patrios Troia Roma deos.

plurima litterulis signata sepulcra loquuntur
martyr-is aut nomen aut epigramma aliquod,

sunt et muta tamen tacitas claudentia tumbas
marmora, quae solum significant numerum. 10

quanta virum iaceant congestis corpora acervis
nosse licet, quorum nomina nulla legas.

sexaginta illic defossas mole sub una
reliquias memini me didicisse hominum,

⁴¹ The tradition of Hippolytus as here presented is very ’

uncertain. He seems indeed certainly to have been the
theologian whose burial-place on the Via Tiburtina is known,
and who was a presbyter at Rome, where he was opposed to
bishop Callistus. In 235 he was banished to Sardinia, and it
is commonly supposed that he died there soon afterwards.
Prudentius seems to have derived his statements partly from
an inscription set up by Damasus (Pope 366-384) at the
burial-place (see Antholoqiae Latinae Supplemaentum, Damasi
Epiqrammata, ed. Ihm, Leipzig, 1895, no· 37), artly from a
picture which he saw there (cf. lines 123 ff.). gamasus him-
self says that he relied on purely oral tradition which he does
not guarantee (“ haec audita refert Damasus; probat omnia
Christus ’'). He attributes to Hippolytus, as does Prudentius
(19 ff.), adherence to the Novatian schism, which he is saidto
have repudiated on his way to martyrdom this would imply ,,
that he returned from exile and lived till the middle of the .
