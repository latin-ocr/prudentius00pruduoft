MARTYRS or CAESARAUGUSTA.“

Emumm martyrs’ ashes our people keeps in a
single grave, and Caesaraugusta is the name we
call the city which has this great possession. A
house that is filled with great saints fears not the
downfall of this mortal world, since it bears in its
bosom so many gifts to be offered together to Christ.
When God, seated on a fiery cloud and shaking his
flashing hand, shall come to set up his true balance for
the nations and weigh them justly‚ then from out the
great world every city will raise its head and go
quickly to meet Christ, carrying its costly gifts in
baskets. African Carthage will bring forth thy bones,
Cypriam? teacher of the eloquent lips. Corduba ⁰
will give Acisclus and Zoellus and her three crowns

⁰ Saragossa. The eighteen would appear to have suffered
together, clearly (from lines 101—108) in some persecution
earlier than that of Diocletian, of which St. Vincent was a
wetifimg was bishop of Carthage. Cf. XIII.

⁰ Oordova. The “ three crowns ’' (i.e. three other martyrs)

ἔξω perhaps Faustus, J anuarius and Martialis, who suffered
ere.
