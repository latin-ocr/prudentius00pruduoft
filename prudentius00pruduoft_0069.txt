A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

produced from the mixed blood of two different races.‘¹
Such is the result of the great successes and triumphs
of the Roman power. For the time of Christ's
coming, be assumed, was the way prepared which the
general good will of peace among us had just built
under the rule of Rome. For what room could there
have been for God in a savage world and in human
hearts at variance, each according to its different
interest maintaining its own claims, as once things
were? Where sentiments are thus disordered in
man’s breast, agreement upset, and faction in the
soul, neither pure wisdom visits nor God enters.
But if · a supremacy in the soul, having gained
authority to rule, checks the impulses of refractory
appetite and rebellious flesh and controls all its
passions under a single order, the constitution of life
becomes stable and a settled way of thought draws in
God in the heart and subj ects itself to one Lord.
Come then, Almighty3 here is a world in harmony 3
do Thou enter it. An earth receives Thee now, O
Christ, which peace and Rome hold in a bond of
union. These Thou dost command to be the heads and
highest powers of the world. Rome without peace
finds no favour with Thee3 and it is the supremacy of
Rome, keeping down disorders here or there by the
awe of her sovereignty, that secures the peace, so
that Thou hast pleasure in it. She has not been
robbed of the might of her former valour and grown
feeble with age, she has not felt the force of time, and
it is with no shaking arm that she takes up her
weapons at the call of war. With no such failing
voice does she petition her august emperors as that

expressed by Prudentius‘ contemporary Claudian, De Consulatu
Stilichonis, ΠΙ, 150 ff.
