CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, IV

forth the names of J ulia and Quintilian together.
Let the choir sing of Publius and tell again the story
of Fronto's victory, of the sufferings good Felix bore,
and brave Caecilianus, of the much blood that dyed
thy warfare‚ Evotius, and thine, Primitivus; and let

metre refuses. Old times of long ago tell that they
were each called Saturninus. Love of their golden
names makes light of the rules of verse,⁴² and concern
to speak of the saints is never incorrect nor bar-
barous. The measure of art is full if we recite to
Christ the forms of the names as they are written
down and contained in the book of heaven which shall
be opened at the due time. Then shall the angel in
presence of the Father and the Son rehearse the
names of the eighteen saints who hold the govern-
ance of a single city in right of their burial here.
And over and above the ancient number will be
brought in the girl who lived on after exemplary
suffering, and the death of Vincent, whose blood and
glory draw from here3 with Gaius and thee, Cre-
mentius, for you twain are not to be passed over;

⁴² The names from Optatus to the four Saturnini are eighteen.
In line 163 the poet deliberately violates the Sapphic metre by
beginning with a spondee in order to admit the name. Eugenius
of Toledo in a poem on the basilica of the eighteen martyrs
contrives to get all the names in by writing successive lines in
different metres. He does not mention the name Saturninus,
but four in his list which are not in that of Prudentius are
Cassianus, J anuarius, Matutinus and Faustus. ¹ These may

have borne the name Saturninus also. He also gives Julius,
not Julia (see line 151).

² Lines 181-188 are wantiny 'in A, the oldest MS„ and are
bracketed by Beryman.
