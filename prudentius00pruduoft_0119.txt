CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, I

less, blanching in amazement3 but in spite of all he
carrigdlthe stroke through, so that their glory should
not e ost.

Believe ye now, ye Vascones, once dull pagans, how
holy was the blood which cruel superstition sacrificed?
Believe ye that the victims' spirits were taken back to
God? See how clearly here α wild devils are subdued,
which like wolves capture and devour men's hearts,
choking their very minds and mingling with their
senses. For then the maniac possessed by his enemy
is presented here foaming at the mouth and rolling
his blood-shot eyes, to be cleansed by the trial of sins
which are not his own. You may hear woeful cries of
&ug-{3¹1¹ ἶῆἕιῗὲἓ ῗῖἶοῖἰξῦῗέἓ Γξέἕίοὴῗέιῗῑξ, ·Μιῗὲἒὲἶ)ιύῗξέζ
the rack and his limbs are stretched ὃ with cords
invisible. In such wise does the virtue that is in the
martyrs beat down the filthy devil, constrain, torture,
burn, enchain him, till the plunderer is so harried
that he slips out of his victim’s marrows and departs.
He leaves his prey unharmed, fleeing with bloodless
jaws; from the tip of his toe to the hair of his head
he gives back all uninjured, while he confesses that
he himself is burning, for he is a dweller in hell. I
need not tell how bodies whitened by lasting diseases
have been cleansed of them, cases in which a cold
shivering shakes limbs that have lost their colour,
how in one a swelling leaves the face, or in another
the natural hue returns. This blessing the Saviour
himself bestowed for our advantage when He con-
secrated the martyrs’ bodies in our town, where now
they protect the folk who dwell by Ebro’s waters.
