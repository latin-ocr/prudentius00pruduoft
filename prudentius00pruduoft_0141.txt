CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, II

authority? You say ⁴ I am ready to die; to the
martyr death is an obj eet of desire.' You Christians
have, we know, this vain persuasion. But I shall not
grant your wish to be presented with a short way
to your end in a quiek death. I shall not let you die
in a hurry. I shall hold on to your life and prolong it
through slow‚ unceasing punishments3 a death which
keeps you fast in its toils will drag out long-lasting
pains. Lay the coals not too hot, so that the heat
shall not be too fiery and seize on the stiff-necked
fellow’s face and get into the depths of his breast.
Let its hot breath die down and languish so as to
pour out with no strong gust but by degrees temper
the torments and only seorch his body.⁰ It is well
that of them all the head of their secret rites has
fallen into our hands, for 'he by himself will furnish
an example of what they next must fear. Get up on
to the pyre they have laid for you, lie down on the
bed you deserve3 and then, if you like, argue that
my god of fire is nothing.'’ ’

While the prefect was thus speaking, the cruel
tormentors all around were making ready to strip
the martyr of his robe and bind his limbs and streteh
them out. His face shone with beauty and a glory
was shed around him. Such was the countenance

⁴² He was laid on the gridiron‚ cf. line 3983 (“ craticulae
impositus,” Augustino, Sermo‘n 302).
