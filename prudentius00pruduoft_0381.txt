SCENES FROM HISTORY

⁷ XLV. Tm: PAss10N 01⁴* STEPHEN

Stephen is the first ’co enter into the reward for
blood, being dashed down under a rain of stones.
But while he is bleeding amid the stones he asks
Christ that the stoning may not be laid to his enemies'

charge. How marvellous the love shown by the first
who won the crown! α ⁷

XLVI. Tm: Bmurmur, GATE

The gate of the Temple which men called the
Beautiful still stands. It is the illustrious work of
Solomon‚ but at that gate a greater work of Christ
shone forth. For a lame man bidden by Peter’s lips

to rise ‘was amazed to find his feet loosened and able
to run.

XLVII. Pnrssa’s V1s10N

Peter dreams that a dish filled with all kinds of
beasts has come down from high heaven. He refuses
to eat, but the Lord bids him count all clean. He
arises, and calls the unelean nations into the know-
ledge of the divine mysteries.⁶

XLVIII. Tm: Cnoan vassen

Here one who was formerly a ravening wolf is
clothed in a soft fleece. He who was Saul loses his
sight and becomes Paul. Then he receives his vision
again and is made an apostle and a teacher of the
nations, having power with his lips to change crows
into doves.‘²
