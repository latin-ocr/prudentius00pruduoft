A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

bodies'of men who once enriched themselves by their
ill-famed plundering now lie piled in heaps. Thou
wilt marvel, Posterity, in late ages at corpses lying
unburied far over the ground, which have covered the
fields of Pollentia with their bones. If I was able to
lift my head from the desolation of ashes after I was
laidlow by the hands of the Gauls3 if at Camillus'
return, still smoking as I was, ,I received back my
standards with a smiling face ⁰3 if I could wreathe my
sad ruins with garlands and gird my listing towers
with bay, with what feelings shall I take thee to my
beart, most valorous emperor? What flowers shall I
scatter, in what wreaths set my halls, with what
drapings hang my gates in celebration? For this
great war has not touched me, but while thou didst
stand under arms I have been free and the Goths'
invasion only reached my ears. Mount the triumphal
car, take thy spoils and come hither with Christ by
thy side. Let me take the chains from off you
captive throngs, drop the manacles that long bondage
has worn smooth, ye troops of matrons and young
men! b Let the old man be no longer a slave in
exile from the home of his ancestors, and the child
begin to know himself free-born, now that his mother
has come back> to his father's house. Begone all
fear! We have won the victory3 now will we leap
with joy. What success like this fell to us when long
ago the Carthaginian captain was driven away?
He, after attacking our gate and shaking its bars
with his strokes, weakened himself with the waters of
Baiae, with indulgence forsook his hardy strength,
