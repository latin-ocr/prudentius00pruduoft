like Christ and keep the saith.

Tradition tells that there was a pit which had been
opened by command in the midst of a piece of level
ground and filled nearly to the brim with smoking
lime, the heated stones pouring out fire, the snow-
white dust hot, capable of burning anything it
touched and killing with the smell of its breath.
They say an altar was set up by the top of the pit
and the order was that the Christians must either
offer in sacrifice a grain of salt or a sow’s liver, or
else throw themselves into the depths in the midst of
the pit. Three hundred together sprang forward
eagerly with a quick rush and sank in the powdery
gulf, where the dry sea swallowed them, enveloping
the plunging mass in its lowest depths. Whiteness

Sermon 306) explainsthe phrase as derived from their large
number (massa) and the splendour of their cause (candida),
whereas Prudentius makes the adjective refer to the whiteness
of the lime which covered them. It has been suggested (cf.
Allard, op. cit„ p. 116) that they were massacred and the
bodies buried in quicklime, and that this gave rise to the
tradition which Prudentius knew. It has also been conjec-
tured that Candida Massa may have been a place-name
(“ Whitelands ’' ?)‚ since in later Latin massa often means a
demesne; but if this had been the force of the name Augustine
would surely have known it.
