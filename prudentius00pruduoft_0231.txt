CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, VIII

the help of thy right hand set his sole on top of the
sea3 and we know too that Jordan, with its twisting
rambling stream, while rushing on in swift current
turned its course about and fled back towards its
source.⁰ This is the wonderful work of thy power,
O Lord, that now I am held up, floating lightly on the
surface of the water of the river, though by my neck I
drag a rock. Now is the honour of thy name fulfilled
and its power made manifest, before which the
heathen in their dulness stand amazed. Bring now
to an end, I pray, good Christ, the things that are
hindering this soul of mine. Thy power is proved by
the water of the river, which is carrying a stone.
Grant me now this that remains, the most precious
gift of all, to die for Thee, O God Christ.'' As he
prays, breath and voice and warmth of life together
leave ‘him; his spirit mounts on high, the weight of

f the stone grows heavy, and the waters receive his

body.
