dragging the torturer after him, while the ushers of
the court are dumb with amazement. As he stands
face to face, the oppressor thus addresses him z ‘⁴ You
monstrous villain, base and infamous, you are the
disturber of the city's peace, like a stormy wind
disordering the fickle mob's' inconstant minds so
that the ignorant rabble shall not submit to the law.
The uneducated multitude has believed a doctrine
that appeals to the people under the guise of glory,
so that they aver that they are to be made immortal
through all time if, like the Giants,‘² they make war
on the gods and in defeat are buried under flaming
mountains. It is you, you wretch, who have con-
trived this exhibition of bloody calamity from the
slaughter of citizens who, because they are impious
and guilty of bringing sin upon the world, cannot fail
to be put to death as the result of your teaching.
You are the cause of their death, you lead them on to
do evil. To my mind it is just that the fate which
your wicked instigation has driven many to suffer,
as much as if you were their executioner, should
come back on yourself, and that for the great
slaughters soon to happen you should be the first to
pay the penalty of death, suffering yourself what you
urged that they should suffer.”

To this Romanus answered with bold speech:
‘⁴ Gladly, sir, and with no shirking, do I accept the
part of being sacrificed alone for the faithful people· ,

“The Giants' m the Greek mythology were sons of Earth
who at her instigation made war on the gods but were defeated
and imprisoned under volcanio mountains such as Enna (Of.

Aeneid, ΙΙΙ, 578 ff. ).
