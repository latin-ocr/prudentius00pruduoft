A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

under a Trojan roof3 before Priam's father‘¹ hired
workmen to build his walls, before the maiden Pallas
founded her own dear Athens—for it was in these
cities‚ as they tell, that the Vestal fire was first
caught from the primal touchwood, and Phrygian or
¹Greek fed the hearths and held them sacred.‘² The
deviations and unsteadiness of the elements are
ancient; they are often shaken out of their proper
limits and rush into happenings which do not belong
to their law or the course of the year. Sometimes
wasting rust consumes the crop, arising from a taint
and malignity in the air ; sometimes in a warm spring
after the west winds have blown, an icy blast from
the cold north burns a fault into the corn, staining
the blighted head of the stalk soot-blaek; or while
the blade is sprouting and swelling from the tendet
seed it is shrivelled and killed by uninterrupted hard
frosts3 it cannot fix its slender tissue in the earth,
and then as the frost goes deeper it is forced out of
the ground and lies above it, the bare root torn away
> with no soil to cover it. Twin-spiked caltrops and the
prickly thistle come up, those produced by parching
drought, this by soaking moisture. The weather by
defect or exeess brings on these plagues of the earth
and sickens and hurts the world. In the same way
the functioning of our body often goes wrong and
lapses into some imperfection3 it does not continue
in the right system, and by getting out of control
brings disease on our organs. For the constitution
of the world and of this body which we wear is one3
it is the same nature that upholds both. Produced
from nothing they grow up, and because they are
destined to return to nothingness they either become
infirm through disease or they are overcome by time
