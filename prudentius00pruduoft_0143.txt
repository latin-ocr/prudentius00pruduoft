CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, II

that the bearer of the law brought down from the
mountain on his return, and the J ewish people, having
stained and tarnished itself with the golden ox, was
greatly afraid of him and turned its face away because
it could not bear the presence of God.⁰ Such again
was the glory which Stephen presented shining on
his face as amid the rain of stones he gazed at the
open heavens.²’ This was made visible farther off
to the brethren lately cleansed from sin, whom
baptism given not long before had made fit to
receive Christ3 but the blind eyes of the ungodly‚
their face being covered over with the blackness of
night and enveloped under a veil of darkness, saw
not the brilliance. It was like the Egyptian plague
which, while it condemned the barbarians to dark-
neSS, gave to the Hebrews the clear light of day.⁶
Even the very nature of the smell arising from the
scorched skin gave the two parties contrary sensa-
tions: to the one it was the smell of roasting, to the
other the scent of nectar3 the same sense, varied
by a different aura, in the one case brought on the
nostrils an avenging horror, in the other charmed
them with delight. So is God an everlasting fire3
for Christ is the true fire, it is He who fills the
'righteous with light and burns the guilty.
