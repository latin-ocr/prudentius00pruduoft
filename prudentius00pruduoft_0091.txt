* in many windings under a guide who will not let you
go to the Lord of salvaffion, but shows you the road
to death along by-ways—by-ways which are tricked
out with short—lived benefits but at the end are grim
and plunge suddenly down headlong to Charybdis?
Away, ye pagans! You have no fellowship in the
way with the people of God. Depart ye afar, and
enter into your own darkness, whither that guide
calls you, who goes before you over tangled ways
far from the road, in the night of hell! But for us as
we seek the Lord of life the one way is light and clear
day and grace unmixed3 we follow hope, walking by
saith and enjoying things to come, to which the joys
of this present life do not attain, for the pleasure that
is gained already and that is to be gained hereafter
do not run side by side.

The deputy' s last tearful, sorrowful complaint is
that sacrificial grain is refused to the altars of Pallas,
grants to the very Vestals, and maintenance to the
pure choirs,a and that Vesta’s fires are eheated of
their wonted upkeep.⁶ And this, he says, is why our
fields are barren and their fruits scantier, grim
famine rages, and over the whole world mankind are
pale with want and lack of bread. What great,
malignant famine has arisen at this present time,

munity it was essential to keep one fire always alight, and the
duty was probably laid on the daughters of the chief. The
rites of Vesta were the most central and vital feature of the
old state religion, and the Virgins were always held in great
reverence and honour. To this stoppage of support Sym-
machus attributes a subsequent failure of the harvest and
other calamities.
