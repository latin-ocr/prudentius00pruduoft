CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, X

the man was put to death and the God rose again.
Death contended with God while He wore the body,
but in attacking what belongs to us it retired before
that which is immortal. You think this foolishness,
you wise men of the world, but the supreme Father
chose the foolish things of the world so that he who
is foolish in respect of the world might be wise in
the knowledge of God. You repeat the tale of an-
cient days about Romulus and Mars’ she-wolf ⁰ and
the first omen of the vultures3 ⁶ but if you reject
events of modern times, there is nothing so recent as
these. With scaree a thousand years the course of
time fills up this short period from the augur who was
our founder. I could tell you, if I had time, of plenty
of kingdoms long ago established throughout the
world, that were famous long before Jupiter, the
father of Mars, was suckled, as they tell, by the
Gnosian she-goat.⁶ But they are gone, and one day
this present realm too will have gone. This eross of
Christ which you call modern, when at the world's
birth man was first created, was clearly shown by
{grssfflffiffl ἷῗῗᾞὲυἶζῖἷὲῃῗὲῃῗξὲῗ οὲιῗέῗὲοἶῗιῗ
of prophets gall in harmony. Kingsy‚ prophetS,
judges and rulers by their prowess and wars, their
rites and offerings and their pen, did not cease to
depict the form of the cross; the cross was predicted,
the cross was prefigured‚ those olden times absorbed

⁶ In Crete (cf. note on Contra Symm. ΙΙ, 492) the infant
Jupiter was fed by the she-goat Amaltheia (Callimachus,
H ymn Ι, 47-48). Another form of the story makes Amaltheia
{lgyffnph who fed him with goat’s milk (cf. Ovid, Fasti, V,

¹² Cf). for instance, the interpretation of the number 318
in the preface to the Psychomachia.
