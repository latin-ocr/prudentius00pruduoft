A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

?

vitamst Such were the waves on which long ago
† the fate or genius or spirit of the nation drifted to and

fro. At last it learned to discern the right way and
encircled an august head with a diadem, calling
its wearer Father of his Country‚ director of people
and senate, one who was to be leader in war, and

J dictator also and good censor ὓ and master of morals‚

to guard the nation's wealth‚ to punish crimes and
dispense offices of honour. Now if by all these

Ι stages, changing its mind so often, it attained at

last only with difficulty to something which the
nation’s respect can approve and keep by inviolate
covenant, why does it hesitate to recognise the
authority of God, which was unknown to it before
and only at last disclosed? Let us wish it joy, for
it no longer hesitates now. Rome has subjected
herself to Christ and serves God, loathing her former
worships. And by Rome I mean her men, in whom we

ſs believe the city’s mind lies ; not her genius, which is a

vain, unreal fancy. And yet why do Ι find you pagans
imagining but one genius of Rome, seeing that you
are wont to attribute to gates, houses, public baths,
tavei-ns, each its own genius, and throughout every
part of the city at every point imagine thousands of
geniuses, so that no corner shall be without its own
ghost? It only remains for a like delusion to set a
destiny too on every building‚ so that each wall shall
have been laid and erected under its own star, and
in its first hours assigned the fortune under which it
should stand, and the time of its fall. They ascribe
to stones the weak threads of Lachesis ⁰ and believe
that our roos-timbers depend on her whirling spindles,

⁶ One of the three Fates (Parcae) who are represented as
spinning the thread of destiny (6.9. in Catullus, 64, 305 ff.).
