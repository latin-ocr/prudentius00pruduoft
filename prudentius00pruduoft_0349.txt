CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, XIII

Meanwhile Thascius,⁴² gladdened by his people's
end, was brought out ὃ to face the proconsul's
ungovernable rage. Bidden to declare his way of
life, he said: “ I am a worshipper of one God, and I
teaeh the holy mysteries of Christ our Saviour.”
Whereupon the other cried: ‘⁴ Guilt enough!
Thascius himself admits it, and denies J upiter’s
thunderbolt. Get ready the steel, ye executioners.
Let this enemy of idols pay the penalty by the
sword.” Cyprian gave God due thanks and sang in
trium h.

Afrl‘ca wept in sorrow at the departure of the man
whose teaching advaneed her in cultivation, and of
whose eloquence she boasts of having been the pupil.
Afterwards with tears she raised a tomb and eon-
secrated his ashes. Weep no more for this great
blessing! He has attained to the realms of heaven,
yet none the less he moves over the earth and does
not leave this world. He still discourses, still holds
forth, expounding‚ teaching, instructing‚ prophesy-
ing3 and not only does he direct the peoples of
Libya, but goes forth to the east and the west, nur-
turing the Gauls, training the Britons, keeping guard
over Italy, spreading the knowledge of Christ in
farthest Spain. Indeed he is both teacher on earth
and martyr too in heaven3 here he instruets men,
from there as their patron gives them gifts in love.

⁴² Cyprian. In one of his letters (no. 66) he describes himself
as ‘⁴ Cyprianus, qui et Thasoius.”

was in residence (see the Acta Proconsu ria, 2).
