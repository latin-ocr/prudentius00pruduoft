tween the different merits of the living, because her
only duty is to seed them. For the world is our
servant, not our judge3 this function the supreme
Lord of nature reserves for Himself at the appointed
season. Man has now possession of the gifts that
were given him, on the same terms as when they were
granted once for all: the spring flows, the river is
full, the sail-winged sea is cut by ships, the rain
streams down, the thin breeze flies, the air is brisk
and nimble, and the substance of nature becomes
common property available for all so long as the
elements in our service keep their due course. Thus
the good man and he who is guilty of a capital crime
have the benefit of the same stars and the same
benevolenee of the indulgent heavens. Life is
common to all, but me'rit is not. And accordingly
Roman, Dahan, Sarmatian, Vandal, Hun, Gaetulian,
Alamannian, Saxon, Galaulian,⁰ all walk on the same
earth, all have the same sky and the same ocean
bounding our world. And more than that, the
animals drink of our springs, the same dew that gives
grass to the wild asses gives me corn, the dirty sow
bathes in our river, our air enters into the very dogs
and with its light breath animates the bodies of wild
beasts. Yet what is Roman and what is barbarian
, are as different from each other as the four-footed
creature is distinct from the two-footed or the dumb
from the speaking3 and no less apart are they who
loyally obey God's commands from senseless cults
and their superstitionS. So the sharing of air and sky
does not make them alike in their holding to religion 3
it only produces and nurtures and restores their

as the “ modern ” name for the Autololes, an African people
mentioned by Lucan (IV, 677).
