when the mistress of the voice contracts a fault the
exercise of speech also must be lost. Let us make
trial, if you will, what sort of growl a four-footed
beast utters when its tongue is rooted out, what sort
of grunt a tongueless pig makes. . I shall prove that
an animal with a harsh voice and an inarticulate cry
makes never a shriek when it is dumb. By the life
of the emperor I swear I practised my surgical
art honestly, most excellent judge, and without
deception obeyed the orders of authority. It is for
this man to know what god is supplying him with
words3 for my part, how a dumb man comes to be
fluent I know not.''

With these words Aristo tried to clear himself,
but they moved the godless persecutor of the
Christians not at all, and he rushed more and more
into a mad rage. He asked whether that was some—

person who went through the ceremony believed himself to be
