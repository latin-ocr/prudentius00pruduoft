CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, X

circles governs our days and by its returning draws
out the course of the light and the year, that the
fires of the grim pyre shall now be made ready for
you to devour your body in the death it deserves,
since with such wicked obstinacy it opposes the old
established rites and does not give way in defeat
under the sharp pricks of pain, but grows bolder
through its sufferings. What insensibility has put
this unbending spirit in your heart? Your mind is
stubborn and your whole body hardened against feel-
ing; so fanatical is the ruling spirit of this modern
doctrine—for certainly this Christ of yours lived
not long since, and you yourself admit that he was
nailed on a crOSS.'' “ It is that cross which is the
salvation of us all‚” answers Romanus3 ‘⁴ it is man’s
redemption. I know that you, godless man, cannot
grasp the mystery3 because your understanding is
blind you cannot imbibe our mystic doctrine; the

, night is not receptive of anything that belongs to the

day. Yet in the darkness Ι shall hold out a bright
torch and he that is sound will see, while the purblind
will cover his eyeS. ‘ Take the light away,' he who is
past healing will say3 ‘ the brightness is harmful
to one who‘eannot see.’ Listen‚ heathen‚ to that
which you find objectionable and hateful. The king
everlasting put forth the king everlasting‚ who abides
in Him and is not younger in time, since time does
not bound Him3 for He is the ultimate source of all
beginnings and days and times, Christ born of the
Father3 and the Father is what the Son is. The
Son manifested himself to be seen by mortal men,
immortality putting on a mortal body, so that
through the eternal God wearing a body subject to
death ours should be enabled to pass to the heavens3
