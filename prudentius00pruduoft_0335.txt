Tm: PAssmN or Tm: Aposusss Pmmz ΛΝΒ PAUL.

‘⁶ Pnom: are gathering more than is usual for re-
joicings. Tell me, friend, what it means. All over
Rome they are running about in exultation.”

“ Today we have the festival of the apostles’
triumph coming round again, a day made famous by
the blood of Paul and Peter. The same day, but
recurring after a full year‚⁰ saw each of them win the
laurel by a splendid death. The marshland of Tiber‚
washed by the near-by river, knows that its turf
was hallowed by two victories, for it was witness
both of cross and sword, by which a rain of blood
twice flowed over 'che same grass and soaked itJ’
First the sentence of doom carried off Peter, when
under the orders of Nero it was commanded that
he should hang on a high tree. But he, because he
feared to court the glory of his great Master by
emulating the honour of being lifted up to die,
insisted that they should set his head down, his
feet upwards, so that the top of his head should look

that both apostles actually suffered on the same spot. It is
most probable that St. Peter was crucified at Nero's Circus on
the Vatican Hill, and there is an ancient tradition that St. Paul
was beheaded at Aquae Salviae (now Tre Fontane) near the
Via Ostiensis and at some distance from Rome. Cf. lines 45 f.
and see Lanciani, Paqan and Christian Rome, pp. 127, 156.
