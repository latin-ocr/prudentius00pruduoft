A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

paints and aided by the art of her partner poetry.
In this way Homer and bold Apelles α and Numa ⁶

and painting, poetry, and idolatry have a kindred
aim. The power of deception grew strong in three
forms. If it is not so, let it be stated why poets’
tales furnish you with objects of worship from
pictures and waxen figures. Why does the Bere-
cyntian priest mutilate and destroy his loins‚ after
poetry has castrated the fair Attis ?⁶ Why also are

to life and sheltered by Diana in her grove at Aricia in Latium,
from which horses were excluded because they had caused his
death.

the Greek mythology.

it wings like a bird’s.
