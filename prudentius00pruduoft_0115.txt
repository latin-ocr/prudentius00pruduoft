CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, I

offer sacrifice to black idols‚ becoming deserters

’ from Christ. A persecution armed with the sword

axe and double claws,‘² for the love of Christ made
her dauntless. The prison-house fettered men's
necks with hard links and held them fast, the
torturer plied his savage hands at every assize,
integrity was reckoned a crime and faithful speech
was punished. Then was goodness cut down with
the sword and smote the unhappy ground, or laid
on the sorrowful pyre it sucked the flames in
through the mouth3 ¹² sweet was it then for the
righteous to be burned or to suffer the sword.
Hereupon two brothers’ loving hearts grew warm.
Faithful comradeship had ever united them, and
now they stood ready to bear whatsoever their
fortune’s extremity should bring, whether they
must submit their necks to the exeeutioner's axe
after suffering the assault of the craeking scourge or
the burning-hot gridiron,⁶ or must present their
breasts to leopards or lions. ‘⁸ Shall we who are
children of Christ dedicate ourselves to Mammon?
Shall we who wear the likeness of God be slaves to the
world? Never may the‘ heavenly fire mingle with
darkness. Be it enough that our life, taken over
under the bond we gave first, has paid its debt in
full and done with the things of Caesar3 now it is
time to repay to' God all that belongs to God. Away,
ye masters of the standards! Stand off, ye tribunes!
Take away the gold circlets that our wounds have
won. The noble service of the angels calls us now
from here. There Christ is at the head of white-clad
regimentS‚ and from his high throne in royal power
