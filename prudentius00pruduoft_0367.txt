SCENES FROM HISTORY

XVI. Tm: Houst: or RAHAB 'rm-2 HARLOT

J ericho has fallen and only the house of Rahab
stands. The harlot who entertained the holy men—-
so great is the power of saith—is without sear and
her house is saved3 she puts out her bit of scarlet
in face of the flames to catch the eye and be a token

of blood-‘²

XVII. SAMSON

A lion tries to rend Samson, whose hair makes him
invincible. He slays the wild beast, but from 'the
lion's mouth flow streams of honey; and the jawbone
of an ass pours forth water of itself. Foolishness
overflows with water, strength with sweetness.⁶

XVIII. SAMSON

Samson catches three hundred foxes and arms
them with fire, tying brands to their tails behind, and
lets them loose into the Philistines’ ⁶ crops and
burns up their corn. Just so nowadays the cunning
fox of heresy scatters the flames of sin over the

fieldsfi

XIX. DAvm

David was a child, the youngest of his brothers,
and now in charge of J esse 's flock, tuning his harp
by his father’ s sheepfold‚ which was afterwards to be
for the king' s pleasure. Later he makes fearful wars‚
and with a whizzing sling lays low Golia'ch.e
