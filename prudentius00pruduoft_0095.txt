, A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

, Sardinian barns no longer spreading its canvas on
the sea and filling the store-houses of Rome to
bursting. Is the farmer of Carthage, then, filling his
table with wild pears, he of Sicily feeding on herbage
he has plucked from the ground? Is Sardinia now
supplying the people of Remus with acorns from her
oak trees? Are stony cornels now the food of the
Romans? Who comes hungry to the shows in the
great circus? What district α of Rome is enduring
the horrors of want because the Steps ὸ are empty?
What mill on J aniculum ⁶ is silent and at rest?
How great is the produce every province brings,
with what rich and generous fertility the fruitful
world abounds, is shown by the food which the state
- gives to thy people, O Rome, and which feeds the
long idleness of that great multitude. Granted that
one year is perchance a little less fertile than another,
that is nothing strange nor a new thing in the world.
Former generations have learned it by suffering
hunger often, if a blighting atmosphere dried up the
thin clouds under a burning sun and there was no
frequent rain to shed its showers in spring, when the
κ crop was young and green3 if the corn grew up
before it could firm with its tender milk the grains it
had coneeived, and its sap was checked by the breath
of a hot east wind, so that it produced unfertile stalks
and a barren forest of straws cheated the farmer’s
hopes and brought them to nothing. To such failings,
Ι feel sure, the land was subject and was spoiled by
them, even before the Palladium or Vesta with her
fire hid from view kept safe the spirits of the house ἀ

‘² Properly of the store-room (penus). They are often
associated with Vesta, the spirit of the fire.
