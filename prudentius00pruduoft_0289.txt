CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM‚ X

lift the boy high up and slap his buttocks with their
hands, then to take off his clothes and beat him with
the switch, cutting his tender back with cruel strokes
which were to draw from it more milk than blood.
What rock could endure the sight, what unyielding
brass or iron bear it? At every stroke of the willow
on his body the twigs were damp and red with
the thin blood, which the stripe drew in showers
from the dripping weals. Tbey tell that the menacing
cheeks of the men who were lashing him were wet
with tears, for the drops flowed unbidden over their
lips amid their savage growling, and there were no
dry eyes even among the recorders and the ring of
people and the chief men standing there. Only the
mother showed none of this sorrowing, her brow
alone was bright and clear with joy, for in the heart
of the pious piety is the stronger force and from the
love of Christ stands firm and unyielding in the face
of pain, fortifying the emotion of tender fondness.
The child cried out that he was thirsty, for the heat
of his burning breath as the tortures went on com-
pelled him to call for a draught of water3 but his
stern mother, looking at him severely from her place
apart, chid him with austere words: “ I suppose, my
son, you are upset by a weak fear and the dread of
the pain casts you down and overcomes you. This is
not what I promised God the child of my body would
be, this is not the hope of glory for which I bore
you, that you should be able to retreat before death!
You ask for water to drink, though you have near by
the living spring which ever flows and alone waters
all that has life, within and without, spirit and body
both, bestowing immortality on those who drink.
