CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, X

> himself has not temple and altars3 for they are the

manufacturers of gods, or the fathers of deities‚ and if
they had applied themselves with less energy to their
furnaces there would be no east Jupiter. Do you not
blush, foolish man, devoted to pagan worship, to
think that you have always wasted all those victuals
you have absurdly offered to gods like these, made
out of an assemblage of ladles‚ basins, tankards, fry-
ing-pans, broken vessels melted down? After all, I
ean make allowance for these notions in the simple-
tons of the common herd; they are frightened at the
sight of wool of different eolours on a tree-stump,a
and often taken in by a lying mountebank, and in
their eyes everything is holy which the mawkish
babblings of toothless hags have made them think
fearful. But Ι wonder that educated, scholarly
men like you, who are guided by a studied rule of
life, do not know the authority on which rest things
human and divine alike, or how great is the majesty
which rules all created things and has itself created
them all. The everlasting God is a being incompre-
hensible, not limited by our thought or sight. He
passes all the bounds of human intelligence, He can-
not be grasped by our eyes, all without and within
He fills and more than fills. Existing timelessly,
before the first day was, He alone maintains his
being both now and forever in the past. He, who is
himself the true light and the author of true light,
being light, shed forth his light, and this brightness
born of light is the Son. The potency of the Father
and the potency of the Son are one; one splendour

⁰ Of. note on Contra Symm. ΙΙ, 1006. We also hear of a
pine·tree wound round with wool being taken in procession
into the temple of the Magna Mater.
