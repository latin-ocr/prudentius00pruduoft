‘A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

wise that the blood receives from them its nimble
motion and gentle heat, whereby passing through
all the members it quickens the inward parts, warming
the cold, moistening the dry, loosening the hard.
*In this way the living spirit tempers and regulates
the life of man for itself α; but you try to compare it
with an imaginary genius of the walls, which does not
exist nor ever has existed. And further, for the
rule of our bodies the living spirit exercises sovereign
thought, so as to furnish sure protection for their
nakedness and weakness, avoid dangers which they
must fear, provide what is to their advantage, bestir'
itself to acquire different skills, take thought to what
lord it shall subject itself and whom it shall consider
to be the creator of the world, whom the universe
obeyS. But this genius of the city, of which you
speak, tell me, pray, when did it first begin to enter
the little Rome ? Did it flow from the wolf ’s udders
in the wooded valley and nourish the twin children ὸ
in its own birth? Or did it fly through the air with
the vultures,⁶ as a spirit unperceived‚ and suddenly
take shape from a cloud? Does it sit on the house—
tops, or keep to an inner chamber? Does it appoint
laws and establish justice in the courts, or does it
present itself in the ditches of the camp also, gather-
ing bold warriors to arms, rousing them with the
trumpet, pressing them against the foe? Anyone
would see that all this deserves the laughter of the
wise, Yet let us imagine that there is some ghost or
spirit which attends to such things and through
which the commonwealth has derived its destiny and

before the building of Rome (Livy, Ι, 6-7).
