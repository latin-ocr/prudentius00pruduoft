A HYMN IN Howoun or Tm: Hom MARTYRS
Emn'rnmus AND Curmnomus or CALAGURRIS.

Wm'r'rEN in heaven are the names of two martyrs ;α
Christ has entered them there in letters of gold,
while on earth He has recorded them in characters of
blood. For this glory the land of Spain has the for-
tune to be held in honour through all the world.
This spot has seemed to God worthy to keep their
bones, pure enough to be host to their blessed bodies.
It drank in the warm stream when it was wetted
by the slaughter of the twain, and now its people
throng to visit the ground that was coloured with
their holy blood, making petitions with voice and
heart and gifts3 and dwellers in the outside world
too come here, for report has run through all lands
publishing the news that herc are patrons of the
whole earth whose favour they may seek by prayer.
No man here in making his requests has offered
sincerely prayer on prayer in vain3 from here the
petitioner returns happy, with his tears dried, and
conscious that all his righteous requests have been
granted. With such concern for our perils do they
work for us that they suffer no whisper any man has

suffered (73-78), Calagurris (Calahorra) was the chief town
of the Vascones (cf. 94).
