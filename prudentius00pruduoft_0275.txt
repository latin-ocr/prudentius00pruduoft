CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, X

their fury, or a crue] weakness that racks the sick
body, for many a time diseases are armed with a
worse fury. The violence of the claws digging into
one’s side is less than the piercing pain with which
the dire disease of the lungs assaults it. The skin
when it is br'anded with the meta] plates does not
burn as hot as the sever that consumes the veins
with its black gall, or the fire that spreads over the
surface of the skin and roasts it, while the raging
inflammation raises pustules and it is like being
burned with hissing irons. You think it a wretched
fate that Ι am hang-ing here stretched out, with my
arms twisted behind me, that my feet are being
pulled away from me and my joints make noises as
the tendons crack3 but it is just the same when men
cry out in distress that their bones are being torn
asunder because knotty gout or arthritis tortures
them. You all shudder at this handiwork of the
executioners ; but are doctors' hands gentler, when
Hippocrates’ α cruel butchery is going on? The
living flesh is cut and fresh-drawn blood stains the
lancets when festering matter is being scraped
away. Fancy that the surgeons are putting the grim
knife to my ribs and it is cutting me for the good of
my health3 that by which health is restored is not
vexatious. These men appear to be rending my
wasting limbs, but they give healing to the living
substance within. And who does not know how great
is the corruption of the impure morta] flesh? It is
filthy, it swells up, it runs, it stinks‚ it hurts, it is
puffed up with anger, or unbridled in desire, often it is
stained with gall and takes on dark-coloured spots.
