Ἴ A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

provides aught that is decayed or doomed to decay

these, then is He poor and weak and undeserving
of supreme honour, not all-powerful but a vain
shadow of godhead. In such wise Faith wisely infers,

cares of earth. For as far as the earth beneath lies
below and the court of the vaulted heaven is separated
from the world, so far are your worldly things from
my eternal things, eurses from blessings, sin from
goodness, darkness from the clear light of day. Shun,
I counsel you, all that can perish3 all that by reason
of its nature admits of defect and decline reckon as
nothing, since it is destined to return to nothingness.
All that earth produces or contains I myself estab-
lished in the beginning3 I gave the smiling world its
splendid dress and created the beauteous things that
grow in it; yet I willed that there be a due measure
and granted them to be enjoyed frugally, only as
far as the frail, morta] needs of the body and its
fleeting life required, not that man being caught by
desires in vain eagerness should reckon that all good
lies in the sweetness and unsubstantial show of
things which Ι have ordained to run their course in
time 3 and I have set a period in which to prove noble
hearts, lest their goodness being dormant and
unexercised should wield a strength that was nerve-
less, winning no credit in the training-school. For the

classes both version-9 are in the text. The two oldest MSS. are
