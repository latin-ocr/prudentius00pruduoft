CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, X

passage be cut away and it can only gasp. So my
speech sticks and stammers with feeble tongue
and labours in inharmonious measures3 but if thou
sprinkle my heart with the dew from on high and
flood my breast with the milk of the spirit, my
hoarse voice will unloose the sounds which are now
obstructed. The Evangelist has written that the
Messiah himself instructed the apostles in this wise:
“ Seek not with forethought for words when my
mystic doctrine is to be proclaimed. I shall furnish
the unready with what they shall say.'' ‘² In myself I
am dumb, but Christ is master of eloquence3 He
will be my tongue and discourse excellently. He will

last breath while he was being subdued, a bane grown
worse than ever in his latest frenzy. Just so a
serpent wounded by stroke of spear-point bites
back at the steel and keeps on shaking it in the
grip of its teeth, growing more savage with the pain,
but the lance has pierced too deeply and stays fast,
unconscious of the futile danger of the bites.

sent forth proclamations far and wide over the whole
world that any man who chose to live must deny
Christ.⁰ It was that serpent that uttered these
words by the imperial lips, which as he came out of
the tombs of the dead cried: “ Why dost Thou come
so speedily before it is time and destroy my kingdom ?

⁰ Diocletian’s edicte were not so crude (see Parker, History
of the Roman World‚ A.D. 138—337, London, 1935, pp. 236-
237, Mason, op. cit„ pp. 101 ff.) But Galen’us and his Officers
seem to have administered thom in their own spirit.
