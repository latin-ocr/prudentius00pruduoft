Av REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

Isis and Serapis and the Ape with the great ta'il and

μ the Crocodile are the same thing as J uno, Laverna‚‘²

Priapus.⁶ Those thou dost worship, O Nile; these
thou, O Tiber‚ dost venerate. It is the same super-
stition, though the error wears a different hue.
Elsewhere there starts another path, which is hidden
under bushes in the dark, and along it cattle, dumb
animals, creatures that hide> in the woods, make
their way: it is where the mind of man is covered
over, knowing nothing of heaven and living in
captivity under a cruel despot. It thinks there is no
God, for all things are moved by chance and the ages
whirl round under no governor.⁰ This route is
separated by no great distance from these ways which
you tread, you who think there are many deities,

a crowd of supreme gods who are mere monstro- ,

sities. It is a single path, then, on which God is our
guide3 He bids the race of men go by one way,
which He makes straight high up along the slope on
the right,'³ towards the lofty peakS. At firstthe path
appears rude, somewhat rough, grim, and hard3 but
at its end it is most beautiful, furnished with plen-
teous riches, abounding in everlasting light, and able
to make up for the toils of the past. On the manifold
way the guide is the devil, who on the left hand splits
it into the confusion of a hundred paths. One way
he drags bearded ε philosophers, another way men
who are mighty in riches or honour. He tempts
them on with the voices of birds, too, and cheats

¹ them with soothsaying, incites them with the

obscurities of a raving old Sibyl, entangles them in
astrology, drives them on to practise magio arts,

⁶ The beard, like the staff (Hamart. 402), was characteristic
of professed philosophers. Cf. Apoth. 200.
