A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

and trample on sacred modesty, deny something a
kinsman has left in trust with me without a witness,
v though I have it all the while, greedily rob humble
dependents, put an end to a long-lived mother
with a spell, for by putting off her death the old
dame is delaying the next owner’s succession3 and I
have no sear of punishment, for the public statutes
are cheated3 the law sits armed but knows nothing
of the crime that is done in secret; or if the fact
should be disclosed the judge is bribed with gold,
and it is seldom that retribution smites the guilty
with the axe they merit. But why do I meditate
such acts? There is God calling me back with the
menace of his stern majesty3 He tells me that the
record of my works wi'll not be done away by my
death. “ The man who breathes within,'' He
says, “ will not die ; he will pay an everlasting penalty
for misguiding the body placed under his control.
It is not hard for me to set a spiritual being in the
midst of flames. Though being incorporeal it speed
like the wind, I shall catch it none the less and tor-
ment it, for Ι myself am ineorporeal and the only
creator of spirits. And I shall ordain fellowship in
the like punishment for bodies, since I can bring
’ back the ashes into their old shape, and I have no
cause to give up my power for lost. I who was able
to create the new shall restore the dead. There are
examples of my power in the very seeds: nature
teaches them all to come to life again after death.
For they are dried up by the loss of the strength
whereby they lived before; but then, dried up and
dead, they are committed to furrow or trench and lie
there unseen, and though they are buried as in a grave
they rise from their tombs and sprout with life anew.
