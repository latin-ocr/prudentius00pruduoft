A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF ΞΥΜΜᾉ

straying, the way where there is no turning asidex
a by-road nor hesitation at a number of forks. N
Yet I do not deny that a double pathhalways etn-
fronts us and that mortality goes two ways, in uncer-
tainty as to where its ignorance is carrying its step.
The one splits into many branches, but the other
is one and single. One follows after God, the other
worships a number ofdeities and has as many offshoots
as there arc statues in the temples or phantoms flit-
ting about in unsubstantial monstrous shapes. Some
it carries to the Dionysiae rites of Bacchus with his
thyrsus 3 α others it tempts to the festival of Saturn,²’
or teaches the rites of which the infant Jupiter in
hiding demands payment amid the ringing of brass.⁶
And then they seek after the whips and the running
about naked of young men at the Lupercalia‚d
and the Megalesian eunuch, fired with fearful frenzy, ,
is 'called to utter oracles that are dark. Some are ,fa-„Q
ready to go by shorter cross-roads and worship '447an
paltry vegetables in gardens by the Nile, daring to
set leek and onion in the clouds as gods and put
garlic and mustard above the stars in the sky! For

⁴² A very ancient festival at Rome, celebrated on February
l5th. Two companies of youths, called Luperci and elad in
the skins of goats which had been sacrificed, ran round the
boundaries of the Palatine Hill striking at the spectatore
(especially women) with strips of goat-hide.

⁶ There is no evidence that the Egyptians as a nation did

ἴ this. The source of these lines is probably Juvenal, 15, 1-11,

where it is said that Egyptians think it sacrilege to eat leek or
onion. This may have been true of some Egyptians in Roman
times; or it may only be that some abstained from eating
them; the Israelites in Egypt could eat leeks, onions and
garlic freely (Numbers, xi, 5). Animals were venerated in
various ways; in some cases gods were conceived of as

animals or part-animal, and certain animals were sacred to
certain gods.
