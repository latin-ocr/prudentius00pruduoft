PRUDENTIUS

sola errore caret simplex via, nescia flecti

in diverticulum, biviis nec pluribus anceps. 850 .

Non tamen infitior duplex occurrere nobis
semper iter, geminis mortalia partibus ire, ·
cum dubitant quonam ferat ignorantia gressum.
altera multifida est, at simplex altera et una3
una Deum sequitur, divos colit altera plures, 855
et tot sunt eius divortia quot templorum
signa, quot aereis volitant phantasmata monstris.
aut hos thyrsigeri rapit ad Dionysia Bacchi,
inlicit aut alios ad Saturnalia festa,
aut docet occultus quae sacra Diespiter infans 860
inter tinnitus solvi sibi poscat aenos.
iamque Lupercales ferulae nudique petuntur
discursus iuvenum3 Megalesius hinc spado diris
incensus furiis caeca ad responsa vocatur.
sunt qui quadriviis brevioribus ire parati 865
vilia Niliacis venerantur holuscula in hortis,
porrum et caepe deos inponere nubibus ausi,
alliaque et senapin 1 caeli super astra locare.

¹ The M SS. have sex-apen (Beryman) or serapin. senapin ie
G. Meyer's emendation.

⁰ A wand or staff borne by Bacchus (Dionysus) and his

attendants. It was wreathed with ivy and vine-leaves, and ·

togpffihewgzltdrgalllgfqggting for several days from December
l7th‚ began with sacrifices but were mainly kept as a time of
holiday with feasting and jollity. Presents were given
between friends, and slaves were treated as free.

⁶ The Curetes by beating brass on brass in their danee
drowned the eries of the infant Jupiter in Crete and so kept
the secret of his concealment. (See note on line 492 and cf.
Lucretius, Π, 629-639.) Diespiter is explained as an old
nominative case which in ordinary use was displaced by its
vocative Iuppiter.
