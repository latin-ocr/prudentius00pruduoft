CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, XI

was skilled in portraying green bushes had also
figured the red blood in vermilion. One could see
the parts torn asunder and lying scattered in dis-
order up and down at random. The artist had
painted too his loving people walking after him in
tears wherever the inconstant track showed his zig-
zag course. Stunned with grief, they were searching
with their eyes as they went, and gathering the
mangled flesh in their bosoms. One clasps the snowy
head, cherishing the venerable white hair on his
loving breast, while another picks up the shoulders,
the severed hands, πως, elbows‚ knees, bare frag-
ments of legs. With their garments also they wipe
dry the soaking saud, so that no drop shall remain to
dye the dust3 and wherever blood adheres to the
spikes on which its wax-m spray fell, they press a
sponge on it and carry it all away.

Now the thick wood held no longer any part of
the sacred body, nor cheated it of a full burial. Τίιθ
parts were reviewed and found to make the number
belonging to the unmutilated body3 the pathless
ground being cleared, and the boughs and rocks
wiped dry, had nothing of the whole man still to
give up3 and now a site was chosen on which to set a
tomb. They left the river-mouth,⁰ for Rome found
favour with them as the place to keep the holy
remains. Not far outside the wall, near the belt ὃ of
cultivation just beyond it, yawns a cave which goes
deep down in dark pits. Into its hidden depths a
downward path shows the way by turning, winding
steps, with the help of light from a source unseen3
for the light of day enters the first approach as far as

on the outside as well. (Cf. Varro, De Linque, Latina, V,
143, Livy, I, 44, 4-5.)
