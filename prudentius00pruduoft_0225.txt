CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, VI

each man eagerly taking for himself 3* such was the
desire of the brethren to take home consecrated
gifts of the holy ashes, or to carry them in their
bosoms as a trusty pledge. But lest remains which
must one day be raised up again and then be together
with the Lord should be sundered in separate burial-
places at different spots, the three appeared, clad in
snow-white robes, and enjoined that the hallowed
dust be given back and enclosed together in a marble
chamber.

O,threefold honour, triple eminence, whereby our
city's head is lifted up, towering over all the cities of
Spain! We will rejoice in our three patrons, under
whose protection all we peoples of the Pyrenean
lands are cherished. Let a choir of either sex stand
round about ; grown men, girls and boys, old men and
women, sing as befits you of your own Fructuosus.
Let the hymn ring out in praise of Augurius and in

.mingled strains match Eulogius with him3 let us
render song equally to the equal. Here in the city
let the gilded roofs re-echo, there a winning sound
arise from the shore, and the seas keep holiday and
make Song. One day will come a time when in the
dissolution of the world Fructuosus will free thee,
Tarraco, from sore distresses‚ covering thee from
fire3 and perchance under Christ’s favour he will
deign to give relief to my torments too, as he recalls
my sweet hendecasyllables.“

⁶ Le. lines of eleven syllables, the poem being written in the
Phalaecian hendecasyllabic metre.
