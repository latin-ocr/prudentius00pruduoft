A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

your father’s successor possess the credit he has left
over. He forbade that the city should be wetted
with the blood of bulls; do you command that the
dead bodies of wretched men be not offered in
sacrifice. Let no man fall at Rome that his suffer-
ing may give pleasure, nor Virgins delight their
eyes with slaughter upon slaughter. Let the ill-
famed arena be content now with wild beasts only,
and no more make a sport of murder with blood-
stained weapons.‘¹ Let Rome dedicate herself to
God; let her be worthy of her great emperor, being
both mighty in valour and innocent of sin3 let her
follow in goodness the leader she follows in war.

⁶ Oombats of gladiators were abolished in 404.
