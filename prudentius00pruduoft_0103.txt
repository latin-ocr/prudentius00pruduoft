Α REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

this will bring returns an hundredfold from our lands,
where it applies itself with ardour, fearing not lest
weevil lay waste the gathered store or black ant stow
it away in its holes. Our virgins too have their noble
rewards—-modesty‚ the face covered with the holy
veil, honour in private while their figure⁴ is unknown

’ to the public, feasts seldom and slight, a spirit ever

temperate, a law of chastity that is discharged only
with death.⁰ Hence fruit an hundredfold is brought
into their barns, barns never exposed to a thief in
the night, for no thief assails heaven, and the seal of
heavenly things is never broken by dishonesty3 it is
on the earth below that dishonesty is planned.

Now I shall examine the high repute of the Vestals’
virginity, and the justice of its claim to be the
standard for all the honour paid to purity. In the
first place, they are taken in the tender years of
childhood,b before a free choice of their own will,
burning with zeal for the glory of chastity and love
of their gods, can reject the lawful bonds of matri-
mony. Their purity is taken prisoner and made
over to thankless altars. In the poor girls the
gratification of the body disappears not because it is
seorned but because it is taken from them3 the body
is kept immaculate, but not the mind, and there is no
rest on a bed on which the unwedded woman sighs
over a secret wound and the lost chance of marriage.
And then hope survives and so the fire is not wholly

drawn by lot, but later it became customary for fathers to
offer their daughters; in either ease the Pontifex Maximus
laid his hand on the girl and repeated a formula which ended
with the words ‘⁶ I take you, Amata.'’ She was then con-
ducted to the Atrium Vestae (the house of the Vestals) and
passed out of her father's legal control (A. Gellius, Noctes

Atticae, Ι, 12).
