CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, X

Lemnian α is worshipped; and anyone who con-
secrates Hercules as a god with statue or shrine will
feel the wrath of J uno.⁶ You say the poets invent
these tales at their pleasure 3 but they are themselves
devoted, no less than you, to such mystic cults, and
what they describe they worship. Why do you
always find such pleasure in reading of sin? Why is ·
it applauded in the theatres, where you see it enacted ?
The ravisher swan ⁰ does his evil deed on the stage, a
player dances the part of the Thunderer with the
bull’s horns, while you, the high priest, sit and watch
these things and laugh at thern yourself, and never
discredit them by denying their truth, though the
good name of this great deity is soiled. Why does
your reverence burst into loud laughter when the god
pretends he is Alcmena's husband? ἆ Α harlot on
the stage mourns for the wounded Adonis ε with
frankly lustful passion, and are you not moved to
anger at the whoring ascribed to the holy Lady of
Cyprus? Indeed the truth of these stories is clear
to see in thexstatues themselves, where it is shaped in
bronze in the prints of their crimes. What means the
figure of the attendant bird that is always attached
to Jupiter? Of course it is the swift armour-bearer-
pander that carried the debauched youths to the
tyrant. Ceres, her robe girt back, holds out a torch
before her. Why, if not that a god carried off a

ἆ Amphitryo, whose form Jupiter took. The story is the
theme of a play by Plautus. The pantomimus, who enacted
soenes in dumb show (saltare), came into fashion in the early
Em ire.

⁶ I'l'he beloved of Venus. He was killed by a boar while
hunting. Venus is called Cypris because her cult was of
ancient standing in Cyprus. ,

1 Ganymede. See note on Contra Symm, Ι, 61.
