A REPLY TO ADDRESS· OF SYMMACHUS

At this marvel the rest of the men on board were
struck dumb with fear3 Peter alone undismayed
recognised the Lord of heaven and earth and of the
pathless sea, to whose omnipotence it belongs to put

” the wat-ers under his feet. He stretched forth his

hands in prayer, asking for the help he knew so well ;
but Christ, beckoning calmly, bade him leap down
from the ship. Peter obeyed the command, but
searce had he wetted his soles on the surface of the
water when he felt his steps give way and his feet
⁷ slip and sink down. God rebuked the mortal man
for the unsteadiness of his saith and his want of
strength to tread on the waves and follow Christ.
Tlien with his hand He raised his servant and set him
'up and taught him to walk on the heaving surface of
the sea.

In the same way Ι, passing the safe bounds of
silence, am brought into anxious peril by my restless
tongue3 for I cannot, like the disciple Peter, place
my trust both in merit and in saith, but am such an
one as manifold sins have shipwrecked and roll lightly
over the waters. Rash indeed am I, since though
well aware of the night which I am passing in my
darkened life, Ι do not fear to entrust my bark
