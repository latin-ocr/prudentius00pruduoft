SCENES FROM HISTORY

XI. Tm: ΜΑΝΝΑ AND Tm: QuAlLs

The fathers' tents are white with bread that angels
sent. Belief in the fact is sure3 for a golden pitcher
holds manna kept from that time. To the ungrateful
people comes another cloud, and heaps of quails
glut their hunger for flesh.“

XII. Tm: BnAzsN SERPENT IN 'rm-2 Wunmmnss

The dry way through the wilderness was swarming
with deadly serpents and now their poisoned bites
were destroying the people with livid wounds3 but
the wfise leader hangs up on a cross a serpent wrought
in brass to take its force from the venom.⁶

XIII. Tm: LAKE or MYRRH IN THE Wunmmuss

The people thirsted‚ but the pond was harsh to the
taste, holding waters that were bitter in the mouth, a
pool of gall. Moses the holy one says: “ Get me a
piece of wood. Throw it into this pool, and its
bitterness will be turned to a sweet savour.’' ⁰

XIV. Tun Gnovn or ELm IN 'run Wmnnmvnss

The people, led by Moses, came to a place where
they found six springs and again six more, with
glassy water giving moisture to seventy palm-trees.

This mystic grove of Elim represented the number
of the apostles in the Scriptures toofl

XV. Tm: TWELVE Swomzs IN J ORDAN

Jordan with back-flowing stream moves towards
its source, leaving a dry crossing to be trodden by the
people of God3 witness the twelve stones which the
fathers set in the river itself, prefiguring the disciples!
