CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, X

While the martyr was discoursing, Asclepiades
had long been privily nursing wrath within him, for
he was fuming and his ire was deep while he kept this
long silence and displeasure was rising secretly in his
heart. At last he discharged the violence of the
rage he had been cloaking: “ Jupiter! What is it
that I hear from this fellow? He stands amid the
altars and statues of the gods in the middle of the
court while, as I must needs confess, I keep silence,
and delivers a harangue like the wretch he is, be-
fouling all that is sacred with his impious mouth.
Alas for what was held right in our forefathers'
times, the established usages of olden days! Our
generation reviles the institutions devised by kings
like Numa α for the welfare of the state. What
modern error has brought in these sophists to argue
that we must not worship the gods? It is only now
that we have the Christian doctrine arising, after a
thousand years have rolled since the city of Rome
began, not to go back to Nestor ¹² and his times.
Whatever the novelty is that now springs up, it did
not exist in former days. If· you would know the
ultimate source of things, ask Pyrrha.⁶ Where was
this supreme God of yours when under divine favour
Mars' boy Romulus was establishing the stronghold
of the seven hills? Rome owes her auspicious
foundation and her power to Jupiter the Stayer ἆ
and the other gods. This has been ordained since
time began, this is the tradition of our forefathers,

and the stones they threw turned into men and women, thus
restarting the human race.

‘¹ Tradition said that Romulus vowed a temple to Jupiter
with this title for staying the flight of the Romans before the
Sabines (Livy, I, 12).
