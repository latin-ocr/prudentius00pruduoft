A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

to the flood of so great a man3 for none in our time
has greater power of speech to leap and roar and

’ thunder and swell in storms of eloquence. Most easy

’ it were for him to sink me, since I have no skill in
handling my boat, unless Thou, Ο mighty Christ,
reach forth thy hand to aid me with thy divine
power, so that the rush of his eloquent speech shall
not overwhelm me in the deep, but walking step by
step I may stand firm on the rolling waters.

So far I have spoken of the first origins of the old
gods and the causes which gave rise to witless super-
stition in the world, and how Rome now trusts in our
Christ. Now I shall review our opponent’s case and
rebut argument with argument. From what point,
then, do they say he began, from what grounds did
he start so as to turn the pious minds of our leaders ‘¹
with more effect by his seductive skill? Masters
of arms, in the bloom and flower of young manhood,
born amid their father’s campaigns, brought up after
the likeness of their grandsire‚b and fired by historic
examples accumulated in their family, like the artful
orator he is he incites them as if he were sounding the
trump of war, and seeks to whet their spirits with
words like these: ‘⁴ If, sirs, victory gained or to be
gained hereafter is dear to you, let the virgin god-
dess ⁰ keep her dedicated temple while you reign.
Is any man so friendly to our foes as to deny that she
deserves the pious worship of your imperial power,
which she ever favours and fills with glory? ’³ α

⁶ victory. Meetings of the senate began with the burning
of incense on her altar.
