CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, X

Is not the gold that men pile up got for the flesh?
Garments fancifully embroidered, jewels, silk, purple,
are sought after by a thousand artifices for the enjoy-

fatness of the flesh‚ and the pleasure of the flesh
runs through the whole gamut of wickedness. Apply

the weakly flesh, bring about the survival of the spirit,
free from all pain and wearing no longer anything for
the oppressor to lop off. And have no sear, ye that

cheap sacrifice, a slight loss, which only galls us if we
sear to lose that which we must part with. Why
does not our will forestall necessity, and the order of
nature turn into the substance of glory? Let us
account as a prize the loss which the law imposes.

and enjoy the light of God the Father, standing in
the royal court where Christ is king. One day the
heavens will be rolled up like a book,“ the whirling
sun’s globe will fall upon the earth, the sphere that
rules the months will be broken up in destruction,
and God alone together with the righteous will be

it. By the time of Prudentius the codex, the form of book
which we now call a ‘⁶ volume ’', had come into fashion‚ and
in the case of Christian books was predominant.
