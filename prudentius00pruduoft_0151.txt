CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, II

the worship of those base gods flagged, the people
were seen in smaller numbers at their shrines, and
there was a rush to the sanctuary of Christ. In this
warfare Lawrence did not gird a sword on his side,
but turned back the foe's steel against its wielder.
In making war on God’s indomitable witness, the
devil was stabbed himself and fell, and now lies .
prostrate for ever. The death the holy martyr died
was in truth the death of the temples. That day
Vesta saw her Palladian house-spirits ⁰ deserted and
no vengeance follow. All the Romans who used
to reverence Numa’s libation-cuph now crowd the
ehurches of Christ and sound the martyr’s name in
hymns. The very ornaments of the senate, men who
once served as Luperci ⁶ or flamens, now eagerly kiss
the thresholds of apostlcs and martyrs. We see
distinguished families, where both sides are high-
born, dedicate their dear ones, their noble children.
The priest who once wore the head-bands is admitted
to receive the sign of the cross and, Lawrence, a
vVestal Claudia ‘¹ enters thy ehurch.

⁰ On the Lares see Bailey, Phases in the Reliqion of Ancient
Rome, pp. 102-105. The epithet “ Palladian ” is suggested
by the existence of the palladium in the temple of Vesta,
to which it was said to have been brought from Troy (cf.
Contra Symm. Ι, 195), and so implies the most ancient sanctity.

θ I .e. rites which go back to the founder of Roman religious
institutions. Cf. Juvenal, Sat. 6, 342-5.

⁶ See Contra Symm. ΙΙ, 862. Α flamen was a priest assigned
to the service of a particular deity.

‘¹ The name is perhaps chosen as representative of ancient
nobility, perhaps also with reference to the famous Claudia
Quinta, who proved her chastity when the Magna Mater was
12)ξῖηὲ lauded at Ostia (Contra Symm. I, 187, Ovid, Fasti, IV,
