CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, X

descent, a great distinction comes to us, like that of
an office of state, if a witness who uprightly confesses
the name is marked with the branded wounds of iron
and fire and a glorious death follows on his violent
pains. Be not wrongly kind, do not spare me with
indulgent leniency. Do your worst on my body, t'or-
mentor, so that I may be ennobled. If I have the
benefit of victory in these contests to enhance me,
I shall set small store by my father’s or my mother‘s
birth. Even the exalted ranks that men like you
have reached,--what do you reckon them to be?
Do they not pass away quickly, the rods, the axes,
the chair of state, the bordei-ed robe,“ the lictor, the
judgment-seat, and all the thousand badges of
honour on the strength of which you swell with
pride, and then fall flat? When you enter on the
consulship you seed chickens with meal‚³' doing (I' feel
shame to say it l) the work of slaves. The man who
carries the ivory eagle puts on a haughty air on the
strength of it; he is blown up with pride by a
beast’s bone wrought into the shape of a bird.⁶
And when you are prostrate at the base of an altar at
the feet of some statue, lowering yourselves before a
hewn oak tree, what can I think more abject than
you? I know that nobles in their togas bare their

y feet before the car at the rites of the Idaean Motherfl

A paltry black stone encased in silver with a woman's

triumphI, but later apparently borne by consuls. Cf. Contra
Symm. ‚ 349.

ἆ The Magna Mater (see the note on Contra Symm. I, 187).
At the festival of the Megalesia the image was seated in a car
and drawn in proeession. See the descriptions in Lucretius,
ΙΙ, 600 ff., Ovid, Fasti, IV, 181 ff. The ceremonial washing of
the stone in the small stream of the Almo, outside the Porta
Capena at Rome, was performed annually.
