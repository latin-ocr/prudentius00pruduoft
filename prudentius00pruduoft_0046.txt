PRUDENTIUS

praesidium potuere suis adferre sacellis! ’

cernis ut antiqui semper vestigia moris

gressibus incertis varie titubasse probentur

adsciscendo deos maioribus inconpertos, Ι

seque peregrina sub religione dicasse, 365

nec ritus servasse suos? quodcumque sacrorum est

exulat externumque inimicam venit in urbem.

frustra igitur solitis, prava observatio, inhaeres: ’

non est mos patrius, quem diligis, inproba, non est.
sed sollers orator ait fataliter urbem 370

sortitam quonam genio proprium exigat aevum.

“ cunctis nam populis seu moenibus inditur,” inquit,

“ aut fatum aut genius nostrarum more animarum,

quae sub disparili subeunt nova corpora sorte.''

iarn primum qui sit genius vel qui status illi 375

conpetat ignoro, quid possit et unde oriatur,

spiritus informis sine corpore formave et ulla

sit species, et quid sapiat, quae munera curet.

contra animas hominum venis vitalibus intus

‘¹ In this passage and elsewhere there are echoes of Ter·
tullian's Apoloqeticus, where cf. chapters 6 and 25. Different
causes led to the introduction of external cults into Rome.
Tradition said thatin early times the Romans when attackm
a town would‘ ‘evoke’ its god οι· goddess, promising ge qual
or greater honour at Rome (Pliny, Nat. Hiat. XXVIII, q318
cf. Livy, V. 21). The Magna Mater was brought to Rome
from Phry ygia at a time of national difficulty, because on eon-
sultation of the Siby lline Books the senatey was advisedthat
her presence would drive Hannibal out of Italy (Livy, XXIX,
10). Other worships came in as a result of wider and wider
contacts with foreign peoples. The Egyptian and other
oriental cults were long purely private and not moognised by
the state, and some of them at least were at first forbidden to
Roman citizens. There ιε nothing to suggest that S machus
himself was a follower of any of these. It was or the old
formal rites of the state religion that he stood (cf. Dill, p. 16).
