CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM‚ X

thrust into the darkness of the penal prison-house,
and there with a cord an atrocious lictor broke his
neck. So ended his passion, and his soul, freed from
its bondage, passed to heaven.

They say the governor reported all the facts to the
emperor, with a series of scrolls in which he laid out
in order all the details of this great tragic drama, the
oppressor cheerfully entering· all his own wickedness
in packets of records on sheets that were meant to
last. But those the long passage of time destroys,
they are blackened with grime or covered with dust
where they lie undisturbed, old age tatters them or
buries them under ruins3 whereas the page that
Christ has written upon is deathless and in heaven
not a letter fades away. An angel standing in the
presence of God took down all that the martyr said
and all he bore, and not only recorded the words of his
discourse but with his pen drew exact pictur-es of
the wounds on his sides and cheeks and breast and
throat. The measure of blood from each was noted,
and how in each case the gash ploughed out the
wound, whether deep or wide or on the surface‚ long
or short, the violence of the pain, the extent of the
cut3 no drop of blood did he let go for nought.
This book is in the heavenly register‚ preserving the

’ records of glory imperishable, and to be read again

one day by the everlasting Judge, who with just
balance will match the weight of woe and the
abundance of reward. Would that I, standing as I
shall be on the left among the flocks of goats‚ might
be picked out from afar and at Romanus' petition the
King most excellent might say: ‘⁴ Romanus prays
for him. Bring this goat over to me3 let him stand
on my right hand as a lamb and be clothed in a fleece.”
