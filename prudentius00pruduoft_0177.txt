CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, IV

live in the world. Thou didst live and recount the
story of thy sufferings one after another; thou didst
not quit hold of thy flesh though they cut it and
would have robbed thee of it, and thou didst tell
how grievous were the gashes of thy hideous wounds.
The barbarous tormentor tore all thy side, thy blood
was shed, thy limbs mangled, thy breast cut off and
thy bosom laid open down to the very heart. Death
surely when it is carried through is a lesser price to
pay, for it puts an end to the envenomed pains
and quickly gives the body rest in the final sleep.
But the bleeding wound long held thee back, the
burning pain clung long to thy flesh, till corrupt
discharge wasted thy vitals in decay. Though the
sword of the persecutor grudged and denied thee
death to end all, yet the full measure of suffering
gives thee the crown as much as if thou hadst been
slain, and we salute thee as martyr. We saw a part
of thy inwards torn away by the grip of the claws
and lie far off ; wan death possessed something of
thine even in thy lifetime. This honour without
precedent Christ himself gave to our town of
Caesaraugusta to enjoy, that it should be the
consecrated home of a martyr whose life was not
ended.

Therefore since thou art made sacred in virtue of
the white-robed eighteen, being enriched with
Optatus and Lupercus together, come, sing in sacred
song the praises of thine enrolled senators. Tell of
Successus, sing of Martialis. Let thy song celebrate
the death of Urbanus too. and thy melody sound
