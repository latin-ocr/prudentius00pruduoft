A HYMN IN Honotm or ΤΗΕ PAssmN 01⁴¹ THE
Mos'r Bmssm) MARTYR LAWRENCE.

Rome, thou ancient mother of templeS, but now
given up to Christ, Lawrence has led thee to victory
and triumph over barbarous worship. Thou hadst
already conquered haughty kings and held the ⁴
nations in check; now thou dost lay the yoke of thy
power on unnatural idols. This was the one glory
lacking to the honours of the city of the toga, that it
should take savage paganism captive and subdue its
unclean Jupiter, not with the tempestuous strength
of Cossus⁴² or Camillus ⁶ or Caesar, but by the battle in
which the martyr Lawrence shed his blood. The faith
fought in arms ‚not sparing her own blood, for by death
she destroyed death and spent herself to save herself.

Xystus ⁰ the priest had already foretold this when

δ See Contra Symm. ΙΙ, 722.

⁶ Xystus (Sixtus II) was bishop of Rome when Valerian
in 258 issued his second edict, by which the Christian clergy
were condemned to death. Lawrence was his principal
deacon (cf. 37 ff. Augustino calls him archidiaconus). The
term ,sacerdos is often applied to bishops, especially when they
are contrasted with deacons (8.9. VI, 10—l5‚ 43). In spite of
what Prudentius says here it is probable that Xystus was not
crucified but beheaded (Allard, Les Dernieres Perse‘cutions du
I IIme Siecle, 41:11 ed„ Paris, 1924, App. C). Four of his deacons
were executed at the same time ; Lawrence was spared for the
moment, probably because the authorities wished to get
possession of the treasure of which he was in charge.
