PRUDENTIUS

decoquat in massam fervens strictura secures
rursus et ad proprium restillet vena metallum.
induvias caesae pecudes et frigida parvas
praebebat spelunca domos. redeamus ad antra,
pellibus insutis hirtos sumamus amictus. 290 ’
inmanes quondam populi feritate subacta ’
edomiti iam triste fremant iterumque ferinos

in mores redeant atque ad sua prisca recurrant.
praecipitet Scythica iuvenis pietate vietum

votivo de ponte patrem (sic mos fuit olim), 295
caedibus infantum fument Saturnia sacra
flebilibusque truces resonent vagitibus arae.

ipsa casas fragili texat gens 'Romula culmo:

sic tradunt habitasse Remum. regalia faeno

fulcra supersternant aut pelle Libystidis ursae 300
conpositam chlamydem villoso corpore gestent.

talia Trinacrius ductor vel Tuscus habebant.

Roma antiqua sibi non constat versa per aevum

⁶ The word strictura is explained by ancient writers in some-
what different ways. It is perhaps properly the mould into
which the molten metal flows from the furnace and in which it
solidifies. Prudentius suggests that the axes may as well go
backw ards through the processes of manufacture and smelting.

¹³ A reference to the old phrase seaeaqenarioe de ponte, the
meaning of which was a matter of dispute among scholars' in
ancient times, as it still 1s.1t seems to have been ap opular
belief that at one time men of sixty were actually thrownop from
the old wooden bridge (pons sublicius) at Rome into the Tiber· ‚
and the strange ceremony performed annually in May, when
puppets called Argei were thrown from the bridge, was inter- ⁴
preted as a humane substitute for the original sacrifice. For
discussion of ancient and modern theories see Sir James
Frazer’s edition of Ovid's Fasti (note on V, 621) and H. J.
Rose’s edition of Plutarch's Roman Questione, p. 98.
