A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

— whenever the bold leader of the Macedonians‘²

in victory over Amyclae heaped high the ashes
of the temples, did the captured deities choose to be
included in their master’s plunder and carried to a
stronghold in Assyrian Babylon? I will not have
the fame of Rome, her hard-fought wars, her trophies
gained with so much blood, belittled. He disparages
the unconquerable legions and detracts from the
prizes Rome has won, who ascribes to Venus all her
brave deeds and robs the victors of the palm. Vain
then is our wonder at the four-horse chariots on the
top of a triumphal arch, the generals standing in their
chariots high up, a Fabricius, a Curius, here a Drusus,
there a Camillus, and under the generals' feet the
prisoners on bent knee, bowed under the weight
of the yoke, their hands bound behind their backs,
and the broken weapons hung on a heavy-laden
tree·trunk,²'—if it was Flora or Matuta or Ceres or
Larentina who subdued Brennus, Antiochus, Perses,
Pyrrhus, and Mithridates.⁶ Yet, you say, under their
lead favourable omens brought gladdening victories
and the bird of good fortune was on our side. What
is the meaning of valour or glory, if Corvinus was

{g Mars an oak-trunk bearing the arms of his dead enemy
ezentius.

⁶ Brennus was the leader of the Gauls who sacked Rome in
390 B.c. (See note on 688). Antiochus III of Syria was defeated
by L. Scipio in 190 B.c. ; Perses or Perseus the last king of
Macedon, conquered by L. Aemilius Paulus in 168 B.c.;
Pyrrhus king of Epirus, who invaded South Italy and Sicily
and was defeated in 275 B.c.; Mithridates king of Pontus,
who after a long contest with Rome was finally defeated by
Pompeius and put an end to his life in 63 B.c. (Acca) Larenta
or Larentina was an obscure divinity, though in legend she
apgessrs as ainoma? {ho took charge of the infant Romulus
