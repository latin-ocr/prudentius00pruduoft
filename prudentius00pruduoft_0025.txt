A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

won; heap up, to mark thy victory, the crowns of

³ λ kings thou hast slain3 but break the hideous orna-

ments that represent gods thou hast east away.
Then will be preserved for thee in the midst of the
temple the memory of victory not gained on earth
only but beyond the stars.’'

When our leaders interpose such words he goes on
and blows the trumpet with loud music, addueing
long-established custom‚ asserting that nothing is
more agreeable than the wonted ways, and that
nations and men are subject to laws of their own.
“ Just as children,'’ he says, ‘⁴ have different spirits
allotted to them at their birth, so to each city,
when first its walls rise up, its own hour and day
bring a destiny or genius under whose government it
shall bear rule.'’“ And he says further that the
mystery of things, the secrets of truth, can be
grasped through some success men meet with, by
means of the proofs of blessing, if what a man puts to
· the test of trial has a happy outcome3 and that for
our fathers the worship of idols ever brought happy
and prosperous results. He recites the force it gains
through a long period of time, and calls up Rome
herself, with snow-white hair and wrinkled brow, in
plaintive tones calling for the return of her divinities ε
“ I am free3 let me live after my own fashion. Will
there be any to cast up to me my thousand years?
We all draw life from the same atmosphere under the
same sun, all living beings share the same air3
but we follow different paths when we inquire into the
being and nature of God, and by ways far apart
approach the same secret3 every race has its own
