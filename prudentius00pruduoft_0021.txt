Α REPLY TO ADDRESS vOF SYMMACHUS

To these words of the senate’s deputy the brother

5⁵3 leaders calmly answer: “ We know how sweet is

victory to the brave‚ most eloquent speaker of the
Ausonian‘² tongue3 but we know the ways and
method by which she is to be invoked; it was in this

art that our father first trained us in our boyhood,

itbwas this that he himself learned as a boy from the
teaching of his sire. Not with altars nor ground
wheat ι’ is auspicious victory prevailed upon to come.
It is tireless toil, rude courage, surpassing energy of
spirit, burning zeal, forcefulness, painstaking, that
bestow victory, and stark strength in handling arms.
If men at war lack these, then even though a golden
Victory unfold her flashing wings in a marble temple,

. a lofty figure that cost a great price, she will not be

at their side, and their spears turned about will seem
to show her offended. Why, soldier, if you distrust
your own strength, do you equip yourself with the
useless aid of a woman‘s figure? Never has an
armoured legion seen a winged maid whose part it
was to direct the panting warriors' weapons. Seek
you the power that rules victory? It is a man’s own
right hand, and almighty God, no she-warrior with
dressed hair, hovering bare-footed, girt in with a
band, while the robe that clothes her swelling
breasts flows in loose folds over her bosom.⁶ Either
the handiwork of painters has taught you to make a
divinity out of unreal shapes which the poet’s licence
has feigned, or the painter’s pretty art has taken
from your shrine something to copy with diverse
strokes and melted wax ἆ and shape into a figure,

α Wax was used as a medium for binding the pigmenta in
the encaustic process,
