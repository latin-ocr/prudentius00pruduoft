CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, XI

then as you go forward easily you see the dark night
of the place fill the mysterious cavern with blackness,
but you find openings let into the roof far above, so
as to throw bright rays down into the chasm. How·
. ever doubtful you may feel of this fabric of narrow
halls running back on either hand in darksome
galleries, still through the holes pierced in the vault
many a gleam of light makes its way down to the >
hollow interior 'of the disembowelled mount, and

the body of Hippolytus was committeda and by it
has been set an altar dedicated to God. That table
both gives the sacrament and is set there as faithful
guardian of its martyr3 it keeps his bones in the
tomb for the hope of their everlasting deliverer and
feeds the dwellers on Tiber's banks with the holy food.
Wonderful is the grace that attaches to the spot, and
the altar, ever ready to receive its suppliants‚
fosters the hopes of men with kindly favour. When·

soul and body both, I gained help. My glad return,
my chance to embrace you, reverend priest, my
writing these very words, I know that I owe to
Hippolytus, to whom Christ our God has given power
to grant one’s request. The shrine itself which
holds within it that body which the soul sloughed
off, gleams with massive silver. On its front a rich
hand has fixed plates whose smooth surface has a
sheen like the brightness of a concave mirror, and
not content to cover the approach with stones of
Paros,⁶ has added shining precious metals to orna·
