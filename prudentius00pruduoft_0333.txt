CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, XI

its proud grandeur, and gifts have made it rich. A
double row of pillars supporting gilded beams
holds up the panelled roof, and there are also
slender aisles with lower·roof which stand back and
widen the sides all along their length, while up the
middle there stretches a broader passage-way making
open space under a high roof, rising to a loftier
top.“ Facing you, at the top of some steps rises
the pulpit from which the priest proclaims God.
The building even when it is full scarcely admits
the struggling anes of people, and there is turmoil
in the confined space at the packed doorway when
she opens her motherly arms to receive and com-
fort her children and they pile up on her teeming
bosom.

If I remember might, beauteous Rome honours
this martyr on the Ides ¹³ of August, as she herself
names the day in the old fashion, and I should like
you too, holy teacher, to count it among your yearly
festivals. Assuredly he will bring healthful days to
those who venerate him, and give them in return the
reward for honouring his day. Along with the
festivals of Cyprian and Chelidonius and Eulalia let
this day too come round for you. So may Christ
the almighty hear your prayers for the people whose
life has been committed to your care; so may your
sheepfold be full and the wolf shut out from it and
your flock never reduced by his seizing a lamb;
so, when I am left behind like a sick sheep on the

other purposes, became the model for Christian churches.
The plan was not always the same, but that described here, in
which the central part was higher than the side aisles, was

characteristic of most basilicas.
