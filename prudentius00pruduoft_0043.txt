A REPLY To ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

f changed as time passed, making alterations in her
ζ worship, dress, laws, and arms. She practises much
„ that she did not practise when Quirinus a was her
- king. Some things she has ordered for the better,
’ some she has abandoned3 she has never ceased to
ι, change her usage, and has turned long—established

laws to the opposite. Why, senator of Rome, do
you bring up accustomed usages against me, when
many a time a deeision has not stood fast and a
change of mind with regard to it has altered decrees
of senate and people? Even now, whenever it is
for our benefit to depart from wonted ways and reject
manners of the past for a newer style, we are glad
that something which was unknown before has been

- discovered and at last brought to light3 ever by slow

advances does human life grow and develop, im-
proving by long experience. Such is the changing
succession of ages in man, such, one after another,
the variations of his nature. Infancy creeps3 the
child’s step, like its purpose, is weak and unsteady3
vigorous youth burns with hot blood3 then comes the
steadfast age of ripe strength 3 and last of all old age,
better in counsel but feeble in energy, declines in
body though its mind is cleared. By just such stages
has the raee of men led its changeful life through
differing periods of time. Unintelligent in its first
efforts and sunk on the ground, it lived as it were on all
fours3 then in its boyhood, having a mind that
could learn and becoming capable of acquiring skills,
it attained refinement by trying different novelties.
Next it grew up into the hot years of passion, swelling
the while with corruptions, till it worked off the exeess
of vigour and made its strength firm. Now the time

⁰ Romulus became the god Quirinus.
