SCENES FROM HISTORY

VII. Josm’u REcoomssn nv ms Burnum

The same boy who was sold by his brothers' strata-
gem gives in his turn secret order that a bowl be
hidden in a sack of corn3 and when J oseph det-ains
them on accusation of theft the treacherous sale is
discovered. They recognise their brother and are
put to shame by his forgiveness.“

VIII. THE Fun: IN 'rus Busu

God in the form of fire playing on the thorn-bushes
with flashing countenance accosts a young man who
was at that time, as it chanced, the master of a herd.
He being bidden takes his rod, and the rod becomes a
serpent. He unlooses the ties on his feet, and
hastens to Pharaoh's court.⁶

IX. Tm: PASSAGE or THE ΒΕΑ

The righteous man passes on his way in safety
even through the great waters. Behold, the Red
Sea yawns apart for the servants of God, while the
same sea drowns the furious evil-doers. Pharaoh is

fflerwhelmed, but the way was free and open for
oses.c

X. Mosss 'HAS Rncmvm) 'rme LAw

The mountain—top is smoking with the divine fire,
where the tables of stone inscribed with the ten
commandments are handed to Moses. Taking up
the law he returns to his people‚ but their only god is
in the shape of a calf, their god is gold.‘²
