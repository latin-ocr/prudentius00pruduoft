CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, X

an innocent heart, unruffled peace, chastity of body,
the fear of God which is the measure of knowledge,
sober abstinenee in fastings‚ hope ever erect, a hand
ever generous. From these offerings arises a pleasing
steam which surpasses the scent of balsam or incense
or saffron or air drenehed in eastern perfumes. It
mounts from them and is carried right to heaven,
where it wins favour with God and gives Him sweet
delight. Whosoever is an enemy to this teaching and
forbids it, forbids the good life and the pursuit of
holiness, forbids us to direct the soul's activity on
high, and calls our subtle fire to earth, not allowing
the force of wisdom to be awakened. How blind and
sunk in the mire are the pagans! How fleshly the
hearts of the heathen! How dense their error!
How darkened is the race that loves the earth and
devotes itself to the dead body, with eyes ever on
things below, never above! Is it not the height of
unreason, the last degree of folly‚ to think that
ereatures born of marriages are gods, to seek for a
spiritual being after the manner of earth, to dedicate
the world’s elements on the altar and believe that
what has been created is the creator, to pray to a
hewn tree-trunk, to bespatter inscribed stones with
the blood of a hog and make request of altars with
scraps of beef, and when you know that the beings
you deify were mortals, to earess the urns that hold
the dead ashes of guilty men? Cease, thou judge
of this world, to impose wickedness so great on men
who are brave and free. There is nought loftier
than the love of truth. Those who maintain the
name of the everlasting God have nothing to
make them afraid, even death itself is under their
feet.’'
