A REPLY TO THE ADDRESS
OF SYMMACHUS⁶²

BOOK II

PREFACE

SIMON, whom men call Peter, God's chief disciple, once
as the sun was Setting, when the evening turns from
gold to red, had pulled up his curved anchor, courting
the breezes with his canvas and wishing to sail across
the sea. But night brought up such a head-wind as
disturbed the waters from their depths and tossed
and shook the vessel. The boatmen's cries of woe
and lamentation struck the skies amid the whistling in
the ropes, and they had no hope left of escaping
speedy wreck and drowning, when suddenly at some
distance the company, whose perils had blanched
their cheeks, saw Christ treading on the sea just as if

He were walking over a dry shore on a firm path.
