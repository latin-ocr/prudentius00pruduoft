CROWNS or MARTYRDOM, X

Spare me, Son of the Most High, or command that I
take possession of the hearts of the swine.'' ‘² The
prefect Asclepiades, bent on this task, ordered
soldiers to go and carry off the people of the Church
from the very sanctuaries, to be delivered over to
imprisonment unless they rejected the Nazarene
teaching. Then himself meaning to break into the
church, and eager to demolish the Holy of Holies,
he was making ready profanely with ungodly force to
cast down the altar of sacrifice utterly to the ground
and smash the very doors. At this unexpected news
Romanus, a holy man of outstanding boldness,
hastens to give warning before it happens and
brings word that enemies are coming in arms, fortify-
ing the hearts of the fearful with exhortations to
stand ready and not give way before the storm.
The Christian flock is united in the league of one
spirit, ¹ a company undismayed of mothers and
husbands, little children and maidens, all with
determination firmly set to maintain their faith or
be willing to die. The soldiers, being driven back,
report to the tribunal that Romanus is leader of the
people in their refusal to submit and that all are on
fire with a determined boldness, resolutely presenting
their throats uncovered and meaning to meet a
glorious death with fortitude. Thereupon order is
given that Romanus be arrested and brought with
all haste and, because it is he who singly incites and
inflames them all, be put on trial as representative
of the stubborn people. He goes unresisting, asks to
be bound, and of his own accord turns his hands
round behind him. His passion for the martyr's
crown all but outstrips the lictor’s cruel trade, freely
