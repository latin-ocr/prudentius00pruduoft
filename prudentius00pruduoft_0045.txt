is come for it to understand things divine, having
skill, with the thought of a mind unclouded, more
actively to search out mysteries and at last to
watch over its eternal well-being. And yet, if there
is such fondness and solicitude for the old-established
way and such reluctance to depart from former usage,
there is the famous instance in the ancient books
which shows that even at the time of the flood, or
before it, the people which first inhabited the young
earth, dwelling in an empty world, already served
one God. From them our stock in long descent
draws its birth, and now it restores the rule of their
native devotion. But since we are speaking of Roman
worships, 1 show that the very people of Hector’s
blood {² for many a day did not worship many gods
but was content with a shrine here and there and set
but few altars on its hills. Then afterwards as her
valour conquered cities and won her famous triumphs
Rome got herself eountless gods3 amid the smoking
ruins of temples the victor’s armed right hand took
her enemies' images and carried them home in ·
captivity, worshipping them as divinities. One
figure she seized from the ruins of Corinth by the
two seas, another she took for booty from burning
Athens; the defeat of Cleopatra gave her some dog-
headed figures‚⁶ and when she conquered the sands
of Ammon there were horned heads among her
trophies from the African desert. Whenever illus-
trious Rome welcomed with her applause the car
of a triumphing general, she added altars of gods
and of her spoils made herself fresh divinities,—
divinities! though they could not give protection
