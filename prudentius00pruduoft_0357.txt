CROWNS OF MARTYRDOM, XIV

vanities that the inconstant world seizes on, kings,
despots, power and rank, the pomp, of dignitaries
swollen with foolish pride, the masses of silver and
gold which all seek aster with a furious thirst by
every wicked means, the gorgeously built dwellings,
the empty vanities of fancily embroidered garments,
anger, sear, desires, hazards, the alternations of long
sadness and short-lived joy, the smoking brands of
black spite that darken men’s hopes and honour,
and the foulest of all their ills, the filthy clouds of
paganism. All this Agnes tramples on and treads
under foot as she stands and with her heel bears
down on the head of the fierce serpent which be-
spatters all earthly things in the world with his venom
and plunges them in hell; but now that he is sub-
dued by a virgin’s foot he lowers the crests on his
fiery head and in defeat dares not to lift it up.
Meanwhile with two crowns God encircles the
unwedded martyr’s brow3 recompense issuing sixty-
fold from eternal light makes the one, profit an
hundredfold is in the other.

O happy virgin, glory unknown before, noble
dweller in the height of heaven, on our gathered
impurities turn thy face with thy twin diadems,
thou to whom alone the Father of all has granted the
power to make a very brothel pure! I shall be
cleansed by the brightness of thy graeious face if
thou wilt fill my heart. Nothing is impure which
thou dost deign to visit in love or to touch with thy
restoring foot.
