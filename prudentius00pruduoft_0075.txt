· A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

⁹ long since a Getie king⁰ carne from his native
Danube and essayed to wipe out Italy, having sworn
to rase these strongholds to the ground, destroy
our gold—roofed buildings with fire, and dress our
toga-clad nobles in skins. Already in his onward
rush he had trampled down Venetia’s lands with his
squadrons and laid waste the riches of Liguria, and
was pressing hard on the fair countryside by the deep
Po and, passing the river, on 'the soil of Tuscany.
But it was no watchful goose that drove away those
clouds of horsemen, revealing a peril that was hidden
in the darkness of night, but the rude strength of
men, breasts shattered in the elash of battle, a spirit
that feared not to submit to death for its country
and to seek glorious honour through its wounds.
Did that day too bestow its great reward of valour
by Jupiter’s favour? To lead our army and our
power we had a young warrior ²² mighty in Christ,
and his Companion and father Stilicho, and Christ
the one God of both. It was after worship at
Christ’s altar and when the mark of the cross was
’ἑῖἓΐῖἷὲῗοὲῗ ἷξὲ ἓξὲξὲηῗὲΐζῃᾏῖῗᾶἔῖᾛέἔῗ ἒοζῖἶξῗζ
shaft raising the erest of Christ above them. There
the race that for thirty years had plagued Pannonia ἆ
was at last wiped out and paid the penalty. The

gotha were in Italy again and in 410 they took and plundered
ome.

⁶ Honorius became emperor of the West while still a boy
in 395. By his father's arrangement he was under the tute-
lage of Stilicho, an officer of Vandal origin who had risen high
in the ‘Roman military service, and whose daughter he after-
* wards married. ’

⁶ See note on Cath. 5, 56.

¹¹ The Visigoths had been a source of trouble south of the
Danube since 376.
