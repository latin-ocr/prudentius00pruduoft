A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

, Canst thou know or infer what cunning workman it is

that contrives this, or what force it is that acts within
them? Poor mortals, let not the teachings of science

‘ deceive you. Lo, Ι, the Lord of creation, able to

restore that which has perished and passed away,
bring back all withered things to their old forms in
flower or leaf ; and one day I shall do the same for
man, so that he shall rise from his lifeless ashes and
his former frame be established, either, according to
its deserts, to make payment to me through torment
for its sins, or to shine in the seat of supreme goodneSS,
and never again to die, in whatever state it shall
remain. Meanwhile, as long as the union of twofold
being lives, let it remember its creator and humbly
worship and pray to its maker. It was not one who
created the breathing soul and another the body,
nor do manifold powers direct the blessings of the
present life3 it is not one God that provides corn-
crops and the wheat with its ears, while another gives
wine in the clusters of grapes, making the red juice
flow from the laden vine-branch. Ι am He who
makes the green olive-trees rich with their fruits,
which you imagine took their origin from Grecian
Pallas,‘² and assigns to babes for their birth Lucina's
hoursst It is under my law that the two sexes in
bond of union gladly beget young and rejoice in the
continuance of their kind3 but you dishonour this
passion with wanton amours and screen your lewd
acts under cover of your goddess Venus. I alone
rule the elements, and I do not grow weary with the
heavy toil like some poor weak mortal. I have
infinite light, imperishable life, length of days which
your thoughts cannot comprehend; therefore I need

ὓ Lucina (or Juno Lucina) was goddess of birth.
