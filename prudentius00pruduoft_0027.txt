A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

custom, and that is the line along which it must
hasten to reach the great mystery.”

To these fine words flowing with such art Faith
has given the answer, for she before all has skill to
open the first approach to the heart of the true belief.
For when we are concerned with divine things and
striving to reach a conception of Him who was without
beginning and will be without end, who existed before
the primeval darkness and created the world, the
force of the human mind is too petty and limited for
so great a task. If the lesser nature seek to strain its
gaze too keenly and to penetrate the mystery of the
most high God, who would question that its vision is
beaten, its frail power flags, the working of the tired
intellect is thrown out in the little mind and is dulled
and fails under its feeble efforts? But the easy way
of faith calls to believe that the Almighty is He who
not only grants us blessings for the present time but
promises blessings to come, that will last without end
through the long ages, so that I shall not wholly pass
away into empty nothingness and perish after a brief
enjoyment of the light. Estimate the giver of the
gift by the gift itself : it is the eternal who gives the
eternal, the mox-tal who bestows mortal things3
divine gifts are from God, transitory gifts from one
whose life is fleeting. All things which time brings
to a conclusion, which have their end and disappear‚
are made of little worth by their own brief existence ;
they are unworthy of an everlasting giver to whom
belongs the plenitude to live without end and give to
man that which shall be without end. For if God

of the period he suggests that pagans and Christians are really
each in their own way seeking contact with the same divine
power.
