A REPLY TO ADDRESS OF SYMMACHUS

the life that warms all its being: why does it not
also take thought about the practice of religion?
Why does it not look up in freedom to the heavens?
Why, like a prisoner, does it suppose that an un-
changeable destiny has been laid down for it and
imagine itself in bondage to its horoscope? For
now it is free to refuse what formerly it was free to
will, and to wipe out its errors and change its senti-
ments. So for some seven hundred years ‘¹ it drifted
' unsteadily, never knowing what form of rule it wanted
orwhat was the just authority to govern. At the
time when the city took its rise it was under a
monarchic constitution, though the elders too were
partners in administration3 then we see that nobles
of the senatorial stock handled the helrn of policy3
next the multitudes of the commons, joined in
company with the Fathers, ruled long with equal
authority in the direction both of war and peace, the
strength of the nobles lying in the consul, while the
commons placed their trust in the tribune.⁶ Sud-
denly this constitution lost favour and ten chief
dignitaries ⁶ were appointed from the greatest nobles,
with twelve fasces about them, and for each one his
axe. Once more the commonwealth as a whole put
itself again into the hands of a pair of leaders and
allowed consuls to make up the register013 and the
final period was troubled by a bloodstained trium-

authority, typifying the power of scourging and putting to
death. They were carried by lictors.

ὅ Of the names of the yearly magistrates. The consulship
was restored in 449 B.c. and was open to plebeians from 366.
Prudentius ignores a further variation : in most of the years
between 444 and 366 “ military tribunes with consular power ”
were substituted for consuls.
