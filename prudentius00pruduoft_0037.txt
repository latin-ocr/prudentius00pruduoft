A⁷ REPLY To ADDRESS oF SYMMACHUS

no aids for all this government of the world and
ἦ want· no partners nor associates. And further it is

mine to know the legions of angels whom my hand

created, the nature that subsists in my creatures, and
. the purposes for which Ι have them reserved. But
thou dost pass me by and think of a thousand deities,

pretending that they manifest themselves in my

J, powers, so that by division, into parts thou dost

lessen me, from whom no part or form can be cut
away, because my being is single and I cannot be a
part. Only things put together and made are
capable of division3 none created me so that I should
be able to be parted‚ I the one creator of all. Be
assured that what I have formed out of nothing is

ῑ no part of me. Come then, O mortal, build a temple

to me alone and worship me as the one God. Ι seek
no quarried stones, neither the rock that Paros or the
Punic cliff curs, nor that which green Lacedaemon or
stained Synna possesses3 let no man consecrate
natural red stone to mest I love a temple of the
beart, not one of marble. In it stand firm the
golden foundations of faith, the lofty building shines
with holiness snow-white, righteousness covers its
roof high up, and within it life-giving purity colours
the floor with blushing flowers of modesty scattered
over it, and keeps the courts. This is the house that
befits me, the beauteous abode which Ι enter, worthy
of its everlasting heavenly guest. Nor is it a new
seat. My glory and the true light of God flowed into
the flesh3 God enlightened the material element
which He nurtured, its creator made the body a
fit dwelling for Himseff, so that He could rest in a

public buildings, and for floors. The marble from Synna (or
Synnada, in Phrygia) was white with purple veins.
