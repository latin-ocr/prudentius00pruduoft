these commands, rebuking the blood-stained hands
because the claw thrust into him did not enter more

used up all their powers in tearing him to pieces,
their panting exertion had tired and relaxed the
muscles of their arms ; but Vincent was only the more

“ What look is this? Oh shame! '’ cried Datianus in
a passion. ‘⁸ He is joyful and smiling! It is a chal-
lenge! The tortured is bolder than the torturer!
The energy so practised in the death of malefactors
makes no headway in this contest, its skill to hurt
is being beaten. But, you foster-sons of the prison,

awhile that your wearied vigour may revive. When
the wounds are quite dry and the congealed blood is

gathering in a scar, your hand will plough them up
again and tear them open.'’
